1. **Attorney General Bill Barr told multiple people that he is considering quitting his job if Trump doesn't stop tweeting about the Justice Department.** Barr has been sharing his concerns with people close to Trump in the hopes that the message will get back to Trump that he needs to stop publicly musing about the DOJ's ongoing investigations. Last week, Barr said Trump's tweets "make it impossible for me to do my job."

2. **The Pentagon's top policy official is expected to step down soon.** John Rood is the Pentagon's Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and was involved in certifying that Ukraine should receive the $250 million in security assistance at the center of Trump's impeachment inquiry. Rood also reportedly warned Defense Secretary Mark Esper against withholding the aid to Ukraine in an e-mail on July 25, hours after Trump's now-infamous call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
