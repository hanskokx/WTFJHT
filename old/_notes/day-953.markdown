1. **Trump's longtime personal assistant resigned her position and left the White House after it came out that she shared intimate details about Trump's family with reporters**. Madeleine Westerhout resigned after officials learned that she attended an off-the-record dinner with reporters in Bedminster, N.J., where she reportedly shared overly personal details about Trump's life. The specifics of her conversation with the reporters are unclear.

2. **Trump formally established a new military headquarters for the U.S. Space Command**, which will be responsible for defending military satellites and other space systems. The Space Command will draw troops from the other branches of the military, as well as from Trump's proposed Space Force, which is currently waiting to be approved by Congress. The new command will start out with 287 personnel, most of whom are already carrying out space-related tasks under U.S. Strategic Command. The location has yet to be determined, but the Pentagon is currently considering six locations at bases in Colorado, Alabama and California.

3. **The Trump administration told immigrant families who were granted permission to stay in the U.S. for lifesaving medical care that their permission has been rescinded and they have 33 days to leave the country or face deportation**. In most cases, the kind of care these families require is not available in their home countries. The U.S. receives about 1,000 such applications from immigrant families in the country each year. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services did not comment on the latest decision to rescind the permission, but it has said in a previous statement that the agency is no longer considering nonmilitary requests for medical deferred action so it can "focus agency resources on faithfully administering our nationâ€™s lawful immigration system."
