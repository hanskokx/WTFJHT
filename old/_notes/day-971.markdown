1. **Trump ordered two former senior White House aides not to testify at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on possible obstruction of justice by Trump**. Trump also ordered his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski not to answer questions about anything that happened after Trump was elected. Former aides Rob Porter and Rick Dearborn were subpoenaed to appear in front of the committee today, but the White House asserted immunity for both of them. Lewandowski was ordered not to answer any questions about topics where Trump could invoke executive privilege and not to give any information beyond what is already in the Muller report.

2. **Some of the Air Force crews that stayed at Trump's Turnberry resort in Scotland stayed for multiple nights and were showered with gifts during their stays**. The resort gave high-ranking officers "Pride Pins" featuring the resort's iconic lighthouse, which are reserved for VIP members. Low-ranking airmen received other gifts and welcome packages, including Scottish shortbread and other treats. Instead of being restricted to single-night refueling stops, Air Force crews sometimes stayed for multiple nights while the weather cleared up or their planes were repaired.

3. **Trump wants to put a proponent of torture in charge of U.S. human rights policy**. Marshall Billingslea, who currently serves as assistant Treasury secretary for terrorist financing, was involved in Bush-era torture as a senior Pentagon official. During this tenure, Billingslea advocated for the use of torture techniques against the advice of of top military lawyers, dismissed protests against the use of torture by the Armyâ€™s Judge Advocate General, and advocated for Donald Rumsfeld to approve more torture tactics than Rumsfeld had already approved. If confirmed, Billingslea would become the top U.S. executive branch official directly responsible for human rights policy: undersecretary of State for civilian security, democracy and human rights.
