1. **The Trump administration is proposing looser controls on methane emissions, a gas with a potent impact on climate-change**. The proposal is expected to be released today, and it would ease the rules requiring oil and gas sites to monitor their operations for methane leaks and plug them. The move is the latest from an EPA that has already rolled back several Obama-era environmental protections and other limits on the gas, oil, and coal industries. Trump officials say the oil and gas industry already has an economic incentive that will cause companies to limit their methane emissions and monitor for leaks because they are unable to profit from leaks. Several of the world's largest fossil fuel companies, however, have opposed the rollback and urged the Trump administration to leave the current standards in place.

2. **Trump aides admitted that he lied about the "high-level" trade talks with Chinese officials in order to boost markets**. Aides privately conceded that the calls didn't happen the way Trump said they did. They said Trump wanted to project optimism in order to temporarily boost markets, so he conflated comments from China's vice premier with direct communications from the Chinese.

3. **Trump is seriously considering a plan to block more than $250 million in foreign aid to Ukraine**. He has reportedly been considering the plan for weeks, a move that has been spearheaded by his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. The White House recently notified relevant agencies and congressional committees of its intent to block the aid to Ukraine. The funding is seen as a crucial part of U.S. attempts to counter Russia's military involvement in the region.

4. **Former Secretary of Defense James Mattis said in an interview that he had "no choice but to leave" the Trump administration** after Trump announced plans to withdraw the U.S. military from Syria. Mattis has given a series of interviews and public statements in recent weeks indirectly criticizing Trump, but he has refused to directly address Trump's character and fitness for office, citing a "duty of silence" to the administration. "When you leave an administration over clear policy differences," Mattis said, "you need to give the people who are still there as much opportunity as possible to defend the country."
