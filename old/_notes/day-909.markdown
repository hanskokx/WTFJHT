1. **Support for Trump among Republicans rose by five percentage points in the wake of Trump's racist tweets and comments** about four progressive congresswomen of color over the weekend. The national survey found that Trump's net approval rating among Republicans rose to 72%, up five points from the same survey last week.

2. **The House voted to condemn Trump's racist tweets about the four congresswomen as "racist comments."** The vote was largely along party lines, with only four Republicans voting in support of the resolution. The resolution "strongly condemns President Donald Trump's racist comments that have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color."

3. **Rep. Al Green introduced his articles of impeachment against Trump last night**, which could force the House to take up the measure later this week. Green's resolution is unlikely to lead to an actual impeachment vote in the House but, by introducing the articles on the floor, he can force the chamber under House rules to act on it within two legislative days.

1. **Former Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa said his country was aware that WikiLeaks cofounder Julian Assange was interfering in the 2016 presidential election** from inside Ecuador's embassy in London. "We did notice that he was interfering in the elections," Correa said, "and we do not allow that because we have principles, very clear values, as we would not like anyone to interfere in our elections."
