1. **Kellyanne Conway announced that she will leave the Trump administration at the end of the month.** Conway, whose title is counselor to the president, is one of Trump's longest-serving aides. She was Trumpâ€™s third campaign manager in 2016 and the first woman to successfully manage a presidential bid to victory. She says she is leaving the White House to focus on her family. A White House official said Conway met with Trump on Sunday night to let him know she would be leaving. "This is completely my choice and my voice," she said in a statement. "In time, I will announce future plans. For now, and for my beloved children, it will be less drama, more mama."

2. **Twitter flagged one of Trump's tweets about mail drop boxes for making misleading health claims that could "dissuade people from participation in voting."** Trump tweeted on Sunday, without evidence, that mail drop boxes are a "voter security disaster" and are "not Covid sanitized." Twitter labeled the tweet with a "public interest notice" indicating that it violated the company's Civic Integrity Policy, but said in a statement that Trump's tweet would "remain on the service given its relevance to ongoing public conversation." The tweet remained on the platform for more than five hours before the label was added.

3. **The FDA issued an emergency authorization for blood plasma as a treatment for COVID-19.** The announcement comes a day after Trump criticized the agency for moving too slowly to approve the treatment. Last week, the FDA declined to back the treatment over concerns from government scientists that there wasn't enough evidence for the treatment's effectiveness. It's unclear whether the FDA received additional clinical trial data since then that would support the therapy's use. An emergency authorization usually paves the way for expanded use of an experimental therapy, but the agency has distanced itself from a full endorsement of plasma and said more rigorous study is required to prove whether the treatment is effective.

4. **Trump will speak every night of the Republican National Convention this week.** Typically, nominees only speak on the last night of the convention. Trump will deliver his acceptance speech from a stage on the South Lawn at the White House. All of Trump's adult children, including Tiffany, will also speak during the convention. The convention begins tonight at 9 p.m. Eastern. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/republican-convention-trump-show-37b8db5a-8e7b-483f-9ed6-55a8268d880f.html))

5. **Trump's sister criticized him for his lack of principles, his lying and said "you can't trust him."** Maryanne Trump Barr, Trump's oldest sister, was secretly recorded by her niece, Mary Trump. "All he wants to do is appeal to his base," she said. "He has no principles. None. None. And his base, I mean my God, if you were a religious person, you want to help people. Not do this." She also criticized Trump's use of Twitter. "His goddamned tweet and lying, oh my God. I'm talking too freely, but you know. The change of stories. The lack of preparation. The lying. Holy shit." Trump addressed the recording in a statement released by the White House: "Every day it's something else, who cares. I miss my brother, and I'll continue to work hard for the American people. Not everyone agrees, but the results are obvious. Our country will soon be stronger than ever before."
