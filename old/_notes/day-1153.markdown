1. **The Justice Department moved to drop charges against two Russian shell companies accused of financing efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.** Concord Management and Concord Consulting were indicted by Robert Mueller's team in 2018 — along with 13 Russians and the Internet Research Agency — for using social media to spread disinformation, exacerbate U.S. social divisions, and sabotage the 2016 election. Prosecutors recommended that the DOJ drop the charges to prevent Concord from accessing and potentially publishing a cache of documents that includes details about the government’s sources and methods for investigation. In a motion filed on Monday, prosecutors said Concorcd is "eager and aggressive in using the judicial system to gather information about how the United States detects and prevents foreign election interference." Prosecutors are still pursuing charges against the 13 Russians and the Internet Research Agency.

2. **The Department of Veterans Affairs removed its mission statement to serve as a backup health system in times of crisis from its website.** The VA's main three missions are to serve veterans through care, research and training, but a "fourth mission" was added by Congress in 1982: to provide hospital care and medical services to civilians during disasters and emergencies. On Friday, all references to that fourth mission were removed and replaced with information that contains no reference to the mission whatsoever. It is unclear why the page was edited.
