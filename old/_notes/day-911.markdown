1. **The House Judiciary Committee has asked Hope Hicks to clarify her testimony to the committee from last month**. Newly released documents reveal Hicks spoke on the phone with Trump and Cohen about Stormy Daniels and the Trump campaign's attempt to prevent Daniels' story from getting out. Hicks originally stated that she had no information about Daniels other than what she learned from reporters, and that she "had no knowledge of Stormy Daniels other than to say she was going to be mentioned in the story." Committee chairman Jerry Nadler wrote a letter to Hicks asking her if she would like to clarify her testimony, now that the release of new documents "raises substantial questions about the accuracy" of her original statements.

3. **Border protection officers detained three children who are U.S. citizens at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago**. The children had arrived in the U.S. after a trip to Mexico with a relative when they were detained. In an email Customs and Border Protection confirmed that the three girls were detained at Oâ€™Hare because the adult they were traveling with was "deemed inadmissible." The children were eventually released to their mother's custody after an official from the Mexican consulate helped secure an agreement that their mother could come pick them up without being taken into custody herself.
