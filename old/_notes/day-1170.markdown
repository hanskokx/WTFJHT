1. **The White House coronavirus task force is missing 50% of the data for coronavirus tests that have already been conducted.** Dr. Deborah Birx said part of the recent coronavirus stimulus bill requires all data from coronavirus tests be reported to the CDC, but she hasn't received it yet. "I'm telling you, I'm still missing 50% of the data from reporting," Dr. Birx said. "I have 660 \[thousand\] tests reported in. We've done 1.3 million. ... So, we do need to see -- the bill said you need to report. We are still not receiving 100% of the tests." Birx did note, however, that the number of positive tests "is tracking very closely with a number of cases diagnosed."

2. **The Trump administration ended a $200-million pandemic early-warning program in China** and other countries two months before the novel coronavirus began to spread in Wuhan, China. The PREDICT program identified 1,200 different viruses that had the potential to erupt into pandemics, including more than 160 novel coronaviruses. It also trained and supported staff in 60 foreign laboratories. Field work ceased when the funding for PREDICT ran out in September 2019, and organizations that worked on the program laid off dozens of scientists and analysts.

* **[üìå Day 1159:](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/03/23/day-1159/#7-the-trump-administration-eliminate) The Trump administration eliminated a CDC disease expert position in China a few months before the coronavirus pandemic began.** The position, known as resident adviser to the U.S. Field Epidemiology Training Program in China, was funded by the CDC and was focused on helping detect disease outbreaks in China. No other foreign disease experts were embedded to lead the program after Dr. Linda Quick had to leave her post in July amid the U.S. trade dispute with China. The post was officially discontinued as of September 2019. The CDC first learned of a ‚Äúcluster of 27 cases of pneumonia‚Äù of unexplained origin in Wuhan, China on Dec. 31.

* **[üìå Day 1162:](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/03/26/day-1162/#5-the-trump-administration-fired-mor) The Trump administration fired more than two-thirds of the staff working at a key U.S. public health agency operating in China leading up to the coronavirus outbreak.** Staff at the CDC‚Äôs Beijing office was slashed from roughly 47 people to 14 people since Trump took office. The CDC has worked in China for the last 30 years. The National Science Foundation and the USAID office, which helped China monitor and respond to outbreaks, also shuttered their Beijing offices on Trump‚Äôs watch.

1. **Trump's new chief of staff is privately discussing bringing on a new White House Press Secretary.** Mark Meadows is reportedly considering whether to tap Pentagon spokesperson Alyssa Farah or Trump campaign spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany for the position. It is unclear whether Meadows plans to replace Trump's current press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, or simply bring in someone else to supplement Grisham's work.
