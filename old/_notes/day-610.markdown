1. **Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's attorney says her appearance at a hearing on Monday is "not possible" but she could testify later in the week.** Ford's lawyer sent a request to top Senate Judiciary Committee staffers asking to set up a call with them to "discuss the conditions under which \[Ford\] would be prepared to testify next week." Ford has been receiving death threats and has been forced to move out of her home. "She wishes to testify," her attorney wrote to the committee, "provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety. A hearing on Monday is not possible and the committee’s insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event." Kavanaugh also sent a letter to the committee, saying that he will attend the hearing on Monday "so that I can clear my name."

2. **Sen. Diane Feinstein's office has received threats of bodily and sexual harm against her and her staff as a result of her involvement submitting the allegations against Kavanaugh to the FBI.** Some of the threats name specific employees. Feinstein is the second woman senator, after Sen. Susan Collins, whose office has reported receiving such threats. "My office has received some pretty ugly voicemails, threats, terrible things said to my staff," Collins said on Wednesday.

3. **Federal immigration officers from July to September arrested dozens of undocumented immigrants who came forward to care for undocumented children held in U.S. custody.** ICE arrested 41 people who came forward to take care of the children in detention, and the Trump administration is pledging to go after more of them. An ICE official confirmed that the move to more fully vet those who step up to care for undocumented children has served as another opportunity to track down and arrest more undocumented immigrants.

4. **The Trump administration imposed sanctions against the Chinese military on Thursday for purchasing fighter jets and missile systems from Russia.** The purchases constituted a breach of a sweeping U.S. sanctions law that punishes Moscow for interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The Chinese government has demanded that the sanctions be withdrawn. The sanctions block China's Equipment Development Department and its director from applying for export licenses or participating in the U.S. financial system. They also add the EDD and its director to the Treasury Department's list of specially designated individuals with whom Americans are barred from doing business.

5. **Top Democrats have promised to investigate Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke if Democrats win back the House in the midterm election.** Lawmakers say they plan to launch a barrage of congressional inquiries into Zinke's business dealings, travels, political activities and industry relations if the party is able to regain control over the House in November. "Zinke is one the most ethically challenged members of the Cabinet and maybe one of the most ethically challenged secretaries of the Interior we’ve had in living memory," said Rep. Gerry Connolly. Connolly said there is "rich material here to look into his behavior and his fitness for continued service in the office."
