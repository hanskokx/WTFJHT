1. **Another woman accused Trump of sexually assaulting her.** Former model Amy Dorris alleges Trump forced his tongue down her throat, assaulted and groped her all over her body, and held her in a grip she was unable to escape from. The alleged incident occurred at the U.S. Open tennis tournament in 1997. Dorris says the incident left her feeling "sick" and "violated." "He just shoved his tongue down my throat and I was pushing him off," Dorris said. "And then thatâ€™s when his grip became tighter and his hands were very gropey and all over my butt, my breasts, my back, everything." Dorris was 24 at the time, while Trump was 51 and married to his second wife, Marla Maples. Dorris provided evidence to support her account of her encounters with Trump, including her ticket to the U.S. Open and six photos showing her with Trump over several days in New York. Several people who she confided in about the incident also corroborated her account. Trump's attorneys say Trump denies having ever harassed, abused or behaved improperly toward Dorris.

3. **Attorney General William Barr said calls for a nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus represent the "greatest intrusion on civil liberties" in the history of the country, "other than slavery."** Barr was addressing a Constitution Day celebration hosted by Hillsdale College, when the host asked him to explain the "constitutional hurdles" involved in preventing churches from meeting during the pandemic. "You know, putting a national lockdown, stay at home orders, is like house arrest," Barr told the crowd. "Other than slavery, which was a different kind of restraint, this is the greatest intrusion on civil liberties in American history." Barr added that state governors were using their executive powers to stifle citizens and businesses from going back to work. He said governors "treat free citizens as babies that can't take responsibility for themselves and others." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/16/politics/barr-justice-department-speech/index.html))
