1. **Several members of Congress and Attorney General William Barr are calling for investigations following the apparent suicide of billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein**, who was facing federal sex trafficking charges before his death this weekend. On Saturday, Barr said the death of Epstein while in federal custody "raises serious questions that must be answered." Barr also said he consulted with the Inspector General who, in addition to the FBI's investigation, is opening a separate investigation "into the circumstances of Mr. Epstein’s death." Epstein had been briefly placed on suicide watch leading up to his death, but the jail where he was being held transferred his cellmate and allowed Epstein to be housed alone the day before he died, a decision that officials say violated the jail’s procedures.

2. **In the wake of Epstein's death, Trump retweeted an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory suggesting that the Clintons were involved in the death of the accused sex trafficker**. The theory was pushed by the self-described conservative comedian and commentator Terrence Williams. "Died of SUICIDE on 24/7 SUICIDE WATCH ? Yeah right! How does that happen," Williams tweeted.

3. **The day before Epstein's death, thousands of pages of court documents related to his activities were unsealed and released.** The documents detail how hundreds of girls and young women were allegedly trafficked for sex to a range of wealthy business, political and world leaders by Epstein and his madam, Ghislaine Maxwell.

1. **The White House has ordered ICE officials to conduct dozens of additional raids and "workplace enforcement operations" this year**. After the recent raids in Mississippi that led to the arrest of at least 680 undocumented workers, ICE field offices across the country were told to identify at least two locations in their respective regions as potential targets for additional raids.

* **‘If you’re a good worker, papers don’t matter’: How a Trump construction crew has relied on immigrants without legal status**. For nearly two decades, the Trump Organization has relied on a roving crew of Latin American employees at the company’s winery and its golf courses from New York to Florida.

1. **Trump told advisers that he thinks Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should bar Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib from entering Israel** because the two congresswomen support a boycott of Israel over the country's continued occupation of Palestine. Israel passed a law in 2017 that requires the interior minister to block foreign nationals from entering Israel if they have supported boycotting the Jewish state. Trump's reaction came days after the House passed a resolution condemning the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which Omar and Tlaib support.
