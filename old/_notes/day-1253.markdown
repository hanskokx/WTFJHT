1. **Jobless claims in the U.S. totaled 1.48 million last week, higher than the 1.45 million Wall Street estimate.** Meanwhile, the number of people receiving unemployment benefits fell below 20 million for the first time in two months. Continuing claims fell by 767,000 to 19.52 million. 728,120 people filed initial claims under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program. Several states are still having trouble processing claims, even as the additional $600-per-week extended unemployment benefit is scheduled to sunset at the end of July.

2. **Dozens of U.S. Secret Service officers and agents who worked at Trump's rally in Tulsa last weekend were ordered to self-quarantine after two of their colleagues tested positive for the coronavirus.** The Secret Service field office in Tulsa arranged a special testing session at a local hospital to determine which agents contracted the virus while working at the rally. The exact number of Secret Service personnel who have tested positive since then is still unknown because the agency is refusing to divulge that information in order to "protect the privacy of our employees’ health information and for operational security."

3. **Trump will not comply with a new statewide travel advisory when he visits New Jersey this weekend.** The joint advisory from the governors of New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut states that anyone who recently visited a coronavirus hot spot — such as Arizona, where Trump was on Tuesday — must self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival or they will be fined. A White House spokesperson said Trump will not be doing that because he's "not a civilian," and because "anyone who close proximity to him, including staff, guests, and press are tested for COVID-19 and confirmed to be negative." New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy responded by noting that the advisory includes "a carve out for essential workers, and I think by any definition the President of the United States is an essential worker."
