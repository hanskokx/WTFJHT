1. **Negotiators in the House and Senate say they're reached an agreement "in principle" to avoid another partial government shutdown.** The four bipartisan negotiators leading the discussions refused to give specifics about the deal or how it was reached, but they were asked whether the deal included funding for a border wall and a resolution to the issue of beds in detention centers. "We got an agreement on all of it," said Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby. Lawmakers are now checking to make sure the proposal has enough support to pass in the House and the Senate in time for Trump to sign it and avoid another shutdown by the end of the week.

2. **Companies are still spending the corporate windfall from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on massive stock buybacks instead of wage increases and employee bonuses.** Corporations spent $770 billion on buybacks in 2018, and that number is expected to increase to around $940 billion this year when after-tax profits are included. Other portions from the tax cut savings went to dividends or debt reduction.

3. **A small company in Switzerland is being investigated by Robert Mueller's team for its connection to a now-defunct Israeli social media manipulation company called Psy Group, which created a plan to help Trump win in 2016.** Former employees of Psy Group were interviewed by Mueller's team in 2017 about the company's business and ownership structure. Psy Group's business structure was very complicated and included offshore entities registered in the Virgin Islands. It also included a chain of entities in Zurich known as Salix Services AG. Financial documents appear to show that Salix is connected to at least one of the companies that owned Psy Group. One question at the heart of Mueller's interest in Salix and Psy Group involves a $2 million payment from international business and influence-peddler George Nader to former Psy Group owner Joel Zamel. Investigators want to know why Nadler paid Zamel after the 2016 election and where the money went after that.

4. **Former White House communications aide Cliff Sims is suing Trump for using his campaign organization to get back at Sims for writing his tell-all book "Team of Vipers."** Trump claimed Sims violated his NDA by writing the book, and Sims alleges that Trump "is seeking to impose civil liability against Mr. Sims through application of NDAs that apply to information Mr. Sims learned solely during his federal service." The suit also claims that Trump has been selective when it comes to enforcing NDAs against former staffers by going after people like Omarosa and Sims but not Sean Spicer or Corey Lewandowski for their tell-all books.

5. **A BBC cameraman was attacked by a Trump supporter at Trump's rally in El Paso.** Ron Skeans was attacked by a man in a MAGA hat who started screaming "Fuck the media! Fuck the media!" after attempting to knock Skeans off balance while he was filming Trump's speech.  The man was restrained and removed by security. Skeans said he is fine.
