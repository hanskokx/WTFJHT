1. **Dr. Deborah Birx said many of the social distancing guidelines currently in place will have to be extended through the summer.** Although recent trends have given her "great hope" for a slow reopening over the next few months, Birx said "we have to realize that we have to have a breakthrough innovation in testing" in order to get a more accurate picture of how the coronavirus spreads before we can relax social distancing restrictions. She added that her task force plans to continue working with states to scale up testing, and will be specifically working toward advancements in antigen testing so they can know whether someone has already had the virus and allow them to "screen large numbers of individuals quickly." Dr. Anthony Fauci said the U.S. should at least double coronavirus testing efforts in the coming weeks before starting to reopen the economy. The U.S. currently goes through anywhere between 1.5 million and 2 million tests per week, but Fauci says "we should probably should get up to twice that as we get into the next several weeks." He added: "And I think we will."

2. **People receiving their stimulus checks by mail as part of the federal economic response to the coronavirus will also receive a letter from Trump explaining why they're getting the money.** The one-page letter is signed by Trump and comes in an envelope from the IRS. It reads, in part, "We are fully committed to ensuring that you and your family have the support you need to get through this time," and includes the exact amount of money the person will receive and how. The back of the letter includes a translated version of the same text in Spanish. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/26/politics/stimulus-check-coronavirus-letter-donald-trump/index.html))

3. **Trump tweeted — and later deleted — a series of attacks against journalists who received awards for their reporting on Russia and the Mueller investigation.** He called on all reporters who received "Noble Prizes," a misspelling of the word "Nobel," to return them "so that they can be given to the REAL REPORTERS & JOURNALISTS who got it right." The Nobel Prize, however, is not awarded for works of journalism. Trump then quickly deleted the tweets and claimed he was only being sarcastic when he posted them. "Does sarcasm ever work?" he tweeted. It is the second time over the last two weeks that Trump has tried to deflect blame for his comments by claiming that he was being sarcastic.
