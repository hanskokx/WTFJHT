1. **A federal judge in Washington state ordered the Trump administration and the U.S. Postal Service to turn over documents and information about USPS service changes that could undermine mail-in voting.** U.S. District Judge Stanley Bastian gave the administration 10 days to comply with the order. The order is tied to a lawsuit brought by 20 U.S. states over the changes made by Postmaster General Louis Dejoy. The Justice Department opposed the request and argued that responding to the states’ information requests within 10 days would be burdensome and that much of the information the states are seeking is already part of the public record. Among the information sought by the states is a list of all mail sorting machines identified for decommissioning, including their locations, and whether they will be reinstalled if they have already been decommissioned.

2. **The Manhattan district attorney urged the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reject Trump's emergency bid to block a subpoena sent to the president’s accounting firm seeking eight years of tax returns.** Cyrus Vance told the court he should be able to obtain Trump’s tax returns, saying Trump can't immunize himself from a criminal probe of his business practices by pursuing an appeal that he said has "no chance of success." Trump has until Monday to respond in writing. Oral arguments are scheduled for Sept. 1.

3. **Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House during Trump's acceptance speech on the final night of the Republican National Convention.** Inside, a crowd of more than 1,000 attendees, most of whom were not wearing masks, sat inches apart as Trump delivered his more than 70-minute-long speech. Federal officials erected extra fencing around the White House this week to keep protesters farther away from the event.

4. **The Biden campaign bought the web domain KeepAmericaGreat.com and turned it into a full-page anti-Trump display.** "Trump isn’t looking for a second term," the page reads. "He’s looking for a do-over." The page also lists a number of promises Trump had made that the Biden campaign says he hasn’t delivered on. Trump announced that Keep America Great would be his re-election slogan before the formal launch of his campaign last year.

5. **House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she doesn't think there should be any presidential debates between Trump and Biden.** "I don't think there should be any debates," Pelosi said. "I wouldn't legitimize a conversation with him, nor a debate in terms of the presidency of the United States. Now, I know that the Biden campaign thinks in a different way about this." Biden has repeatedly said that he "can hardly wait" to debate Trump. Pelosi added that she thinks Trump will "belittle what the debates are supposed to be about," and that Biden shouldn't "dignify that conversation with Donald Trump."
