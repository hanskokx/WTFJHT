1. **A top commander in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard rejected Trump's invitation to sit down for talks with the United States.** Trump told reporters on Thursday that he would not rule out military action against Iran and said, "What I would like to see with Iran, I would like to see them call me." Gen. Yadollah Javani responded that "there will be no negotiations with America" and claimed that the U.S. wouldn't dare take military action against Iran.

2. **Trump followed through on his threat to increase tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and took steps toward taxing nearly all Chinese imports.** Trump said the move is meant to punish China for attempting to renegotiate a trade deal between the two countries. At one point, Trump mentioned that he received a "beautiful letter" from Chinese President Xi Jinping and wanted to speak with him on the phone, but later said he would be more than happy to keep hitting China with tariffs. "I have no idea what’s going to happen," Trump said. Trump later tweeted that there is "no need to rush" when it comes to securing a trade deal with China.

3. **The Department of Housing and Urban Development confirmed that Trump's plan to evict undocumented immigrants from public housing could displace more than 55,000 children — all of whom are legal U.S. residents or citizens.** The proposed rule would make it harder for undocumented immigrants to access public housing, in order to "make certain our scarce public resources help those who are legally entitled to it," according to HUD Secretary Ben Carson. But the agency's own impact analysis found that half of the people currently living in households that will face eviction and homelessness under the new rule are children who are legally qualified for aid. The new rule is being pushed by White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller.
