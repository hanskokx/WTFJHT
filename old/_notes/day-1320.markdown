1. **The Justice Department secretly took steps in 2017 to prevent investigators from completing an examination of Trump's decades-long personal and business ties to Russia.** Law enforcement officials never fully investigated Trump's relationship with Russia, even though some career FBI counterintelligence investigators thought his ties posed a serious national security threat. Then-deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein curtailed the investigation without telling the FBI, effectively ensuring that it would go nowhere. Rosenstein concluded that the FBI didn't have enough cause investigate Trump's ties to a foreign adversary, and he suspected that the acting bureau director who approved the opening of the inquiry, Andrew McCabe, had conflicts of interest. Rosenstein never told McCabe about his decision. When Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller to lead the investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, he privately instructed Mueller to conduct only a criminal investigation into whether anyone broke the law in connection with Russia’s 2016 election interference, not into potential threats to national security.

2. **Former White House counsel Don McGahn sent a two-page memo in February 2018 to then-Chief of Staff John Kelly arguing that Jared Kushner's security clearance needed to be downgraded**, according to a forthcoming book by Michael Schmidt. Kelly was concerned about giving Kushner a top-secret clearance after receiving a briefing about a routine FBI investigation into Kushner's background. McGahn wrote to Kelly that Kushner's background check "raises serious additional concerns about whether this individual ought to retain a top security clearance until such issues can be investigated and resolved." McGahn instead recommended that Kushner be given interim secret clearance "until further information is received." Ultimately, Trump intervened to ensure Kushner received top-secret security clearance.

3. **Trump praised a caravan of right-wing supporters in Portland, OR a day after a man was shot and killed in confrontations between Black Lives Matter protesters and Trump supporters.** Trump shared a video on Twitter of the pro-Trump caravan driving into Portland and called them "GREAT PATRIOTS!" In another tweet, he referred to protesters in Washington, D.C., as "Disgraceful Anarchists" and said his administration is "watching them closely." Trump also said the "big backlash going on in Portland cannot be unexpected," called the mayor of Portland "a FOOL," and called on the state to "Bring in the National Guard!"

4. **The governor of Wisconsin urged Trump to "reconsider" his planned trip to visit Kenosha amid ongoing protests over the police shooting of Jacob Blake.** Gov. Tony Evers sent a letter to the White House warning that Trump's presence "will only hinder our healing" and "delay our work to overcome division and move forward together." Evers also said he was worried that having Trump in town would require "a massive re-direction of these resources to support your visit at a time when it is critical that we continue to remain focused on keeping the people of Kenosha safe and supporting the community’s response." A White House spokesperson said Trump still plans to visit on Tuesday.
