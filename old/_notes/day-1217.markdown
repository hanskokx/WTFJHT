1. **The Trump administration awarded a $1.3 billion contract to build 42 to miles of border wall to a North Dakota construction firm backed by Trump**. The deal is the largest border wall contract ever awarded. Trump has repeatedly touted the company, Fisher Sand and Gravel, during White House meetings with border officials and military officers. The company's first and only other federal construction contract was for $400 million and is currently under review by the Defense Department after Democrats raised concerns about undue influence over the procurement process by the White House. The latest contract boasts an average cost of more than $30 million per mile of border wall, more expensive than any of Trump's other border wall contracts.

2. **Democrats are launching an investigation into Trump's replacement of the Department of Transportation inspector general who was overseeing an ongoing investigation into Transportation Secretary Ellen Chao's dealings with the state of Kentucky**. Trump tapped Howard Elliot on Friday to replace Mitch Behm as acting DOT inspector general, making Behm the fifth IG that Trump has ousted in recent months. Behm was overseeing an investigation into whether Chao gave preferential treatment to projects in the state where her husband, Mitch McConnell, serves as U.S. senator. In a letter to Chao and Elliot, lawmakers on the House Oversight and Transportation committees said they are "concerned that Mr. Behm’s removal could be an effort to undermine the progress of this investigation, which we understand is ongoing." They added: "Any attempt by you or your office to interfere with the Office of Inspector General’s investigation of yourself is illegal and will be thoroughly examined by our Committees."

3. **Republican political operatives are recruiting "extremely pro-Trump" doctors who are willing to go on TV and make the case for reopening the U.S. economy as quickly as possible**, according to leaked audio from a May 11 conference call with members of the Trump reelection campaign. The Trump campaign communications director confirmed that the effort to recruit doctors to support reopening the economy without waiting to meet the safety benchmarks set by the CDC is currently underway.
