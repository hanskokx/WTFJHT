1. **Former White House chief of staff John Kelly said Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate his political rivals was "tantamount to an illegal order,"** and that Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman was right to report Trump's July 25 call with Volodymyr Zelensky. "He did exactly what we teach them to do from cradle to grave," Kelly said during an event. "He went and told his boss what he just heard." Kelly said Trump's decision to make aid to Ukraine contingent upon Zelensky announcing investigations into his political rivals "essentially changed" U.S. policy toward Ukraine.

2. **Trump plans to take more than $1 billion from the National Guard to pay for border security and the wall**. The $1.3 billion that will be reallocated from the National Guard and reserves equipment budget is part of the $3.8 billion in annual Pentagon funding that will instead be used to build roads, sensor lights, and bollard-style fencing in border areas on federal land.
