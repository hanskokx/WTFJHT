1. **Trump says he will most likely not sit down for an in-person interview with special counsel Robert Mueller** because "we’ve wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is, probably, we’re finished." He also claimed he didn't know that his Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker opposed the Mueller investigation, even though the two of them have had multiple conversations about the probe over the last year.

2. **Trump criticized the retired Navy SEAL who led the raid on Osama bin Laden, saying that he should've caught bin Laden sooner.** Trump called Adm. Bill McRaven a "Hillary Clinton fan" and said "OK, he’s a Hillary Clinton backer and an Obama backer." He continued: "Wouldn’t it have been nice if we got Osama Bin Laden a lot sooner than that. Wouldn’t it have been nice?" Trump offered no suggestions as to how the U.S. should have done so.

3. **The CIA has concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi.** The agency concluded that MBS has so much control over Saudi Arabia that the killing could not have taken place without his approval, as well as intercepts of the crown prince's calls in the day before the killing and calls by the assassination team to a senior aide to the crown prince.
