1. **Trump repeatedly used unsecured cellphones that are vulnerable to monitoring by foreign spies to communicate with Rudy Giuliani and others involved in Trump's campaign to pressure Ukraine**. Phone records released this week revealed Trump's extensive unencrypted communications and his refusal to abide by the security guidance given to him by his aides. "It happened all the time," said one former senior aide. Trump is not identified by name in the phone records, but investigators believe he is the person with a blocked number listed as "-1" in the files.

2. **Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held an off-the-books meeting with group of wealthy conservative donors during the NATO summit in London this week**. Pompeo attended a gathering of the Hamilton Society, which was held at the hotel where Pompeo was staying, without alerting members of the press who were travelling with him. Attendees were required to leave their cellphones outside of the meeting to ensure that nothing Pompeo said during the gathering would be recorded.

3. **The White House directed a Republican senator to block a bill acknowledging the Armenian genocide for a third time**. Sen. Kevin Cramer was asked to prevent lawmakers from passing the bill by unanimous consent, even though he was a co-sponsor of a similar resolution during the last Congress. Cramer said he didn't think it was "the right time" to pass the bill, which would formally recognize Turkey's genocide against the Armenian people, because Trump had just returned from a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan. Cramer also said he does not intend to continue blocking the resolution in the future.
