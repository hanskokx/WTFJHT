1. **Six Democratic House committee chairs sent a letter to AG William Barr requesting that he submit Mueller's full report to Congress by April 12.** The letter says Barr's summary of Mueller's report "is not sufficient for Congress." Lawmakers also called on Barr to turn over the underlying evidence and documents by the same day. Democrats said that providing the report "in complete and unredacted form" would be consistent with DOJ policies and precedent.

2. **The FBI is prepared to brief lawmakers on the counterintelligence findings of Mueller's investigation.** The FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump, but William Barr's summary report of Mueller's findings didn't include any information about whether or not investigators found that Trump or anyone around him might be compromised or influenced by Russia. Officials expect the FBI to brief leaders from the House and Senate, as well as the chairs and ranking members of the intelligence committees in a closed session.

3. **The Trump administration now says the entire Affordable Care Act should be struck down.** In a dramatic reversal, the Justice Department now says it agrees with the ruling of a Texas federal judge that invalidated the ACA. "The Department of Justice has determined that the district court's comprehensive opinion came to the correct conclusion and will support it on appeal," said a DOJ spokesperson.

4. **The Pentagon notified Congress that it has authorized the transfer of $1 billion for new construction of a border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.** Up to $1 billion will go toward the construction of 57 miles of fencing, improving roads, and other measures for the southern border. The DOD authorized the Army Corps of Engineers to start planning and building the project Monday night. The funding will go toward an 18-foot-high fence along the Yuma and El Paso sections of the border. The announcement is just the first $1 billion the administration is providing to fund the border wall, and another $1.5 billion is expected in the near future.
