1. **Trump's budget proposal would reduce the number of repayment options for student loan borrowers and get rid of the public service loan forgiveness program**. The popular program allows employees a non-profit or public institutions to have their federal student loans canceled after making 10 years of on-time payments. Up to a quarter of American workers are estimated to be eligible for the program. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/10/trump-proposes-end-to-student-loan-forgiveness-program.html))

2. **Federal prosecutors recommended that Trump associate Roger Stone serve up to nine years in prison for obstruction of justice, lying to Congress, and witness tampering**. Stone was found guilty in November of all the charges against him and is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 20. In a sentencing memo, federal prosecutors said Stone "obstructed Congress' investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, lied under oath, and tampered with a witness." After he was indicted, the memo continues, "he displayed contempt for this Court and the rule of law." Trump said the recommended sentence was "horrible and very unfair" and that such a "miscarriage of justice" should not be allowed to happen.
