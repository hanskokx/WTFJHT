1. **Federal authorities raided the office of GOP fundraiser Elliot Broidy last summer in order to obtain documents related to Broidy's dealings with foreign officials and Trump administration associates.** Federal agents searched Broidy's office for documents related to China, Saudi Arabia, and a Miami Beach club promoter named Joel Rousseau. Agents were authorized to use Broidy's hands and face to unlock his phones or other electronic devices with fingerprint or face-recognition security features. The sealed warrant reveals government investigators took a similar approach to searching Broidy's offices as they did when searching Michael Cohen's. The search warrant cites three possible crimes that investigators are probing: conspiracy, money laundering, and crimes associated with illegal covert lobbying on behalf of foreign officials.

"Bring back @JudgeJeanine Pirro" Trump tweeted. "The Radical Left Democrats, working closely with their beloved partner, the Fake News Media, is using every trick in the book to SILENCE a majority of our Country." Trump also tweeted a show of support for Tucker Carlson, who recently faced criticism for a series of racist, xenophobic, sexist, and other comments he made during various radio and TV appearances throughout his career. "Stay true," Trump tweeted, "to the people that got you there. Keep fighting for Tucker, and fight hard for @JudgeJeanine."
