1. **The Senate voted  54-46 to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war against Yemen**. The move is largely seen as a rebuke of the Trump administration's continued support for the Saudi monarchy in the wake of the murder Jamal Khashoggi. The U.S. has been supplying money and weapons to the Saudis in support of the kingdom's relentless bombing campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen since the war began in 2015, which has led to widespread humanitarian and health crises in the region. The resolution to end U.S. support for the war must now be taken up in the House, where members passed a nearly identical resolution earlier this year. If Trump vetoes the resolution, however, neither chamber is expected to have the votes required to override the veto.

2. **The Senate is prepared to pass a proposal that would end Trump's national emergency declaration at the southern border**.** **Trump has threatened to veto any such measure that reaches his desk. Only four Republican votes are needed in the Senate, and five GOP senators have said they will support the measure passed in February by the House, but lawmakers will need the support of two-thirds of Congress to override Trump's pending presidential veto if it reaches his desk. Mike Pence met with Republican senators this week to try and persuade them to vote against the bill and instead support a different bill that would end future emergency declarations after 30 days unless Congress approved an extension.

3. **Trump is trying to make a last-minute intervention in Brexit and is looking forward to "negotiating a large scale Trade Deal with the UK"** after he was reportedly lobbied by the former Ukip and "Leave" campaign leader, Nigel Farage. Farage is said to have asked Trump during a meeting in Washington this month to support the UK leaving the EU without a deal in place. Hours after parliament voted to leave the EU without a deal and is preparing to vote on whether to [delay the Brexit deadline](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47557216) by months, Trump tweeted, "My Administration looks forward to negotiating a large scale Trade Deal with the United Kingdom. The potential is unlimited!" The tweet is being interpreted as Trump fulfilling Farage's request.

4. **Adam Schiff suggested that Russians may have laundered money through the Trump Organization and the House Intelligence Committee is investigating the matter**. "One of the issues that we are looking at," Schiff said, "is whether the Russians were laundering money through the Trump Organization." Schiff said the committee is primarily concerned with whether or not Trump is "compromised by a foreign power."

5. **Federal prosecutors have requested documents and emails related to Michael Cohen's alleged "back channel" with Rudy Giuliani regarding the possibility of a pardon for Cohen**. Cohen spoke with attorney Robert J. Costello, who agreed to reach out to Giuliani on Cohen's behalf. Costello spoke with Giuliani roughly a dozen times, and one email referred to their conversations as a "back channel of communication." During one discussion, Costello says he asked whether Trump would put a pardon for Cohen "on the table." Federal prosecutors requested the emails and documents related to those conversations as part of an investigation into "possible violations of federal criminal law." The request offered no additional information about the investigation. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/us/politics/cohen-emails-giuliani.html))
