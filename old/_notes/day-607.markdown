1. **The Trump administration declassified and ordered the release of former FBI director James Comey's text messages and 20 pages of a surveillance application that targeted Carter Page.** Trump also called for the release of Bruce Ohr's notes related to the Russia investigation. "In addition," the statement reads, "President Donald J. Trump has directed the Department of Justice (including the FBI) to publicly release all text messages relating to the Russia investigation, without redaction, of James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and Bruce Ohr." The White House called on the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to immediately declassify and release the materials.

2. **Trump plans to cap the number of refugees allowed into the U.S. next year at 30,000**, the lowest ceiling since the refugee program was created in 1980. The new low represents a reduction of a third, down 15,000 from the 45,000-person limit Trump set for 2018. The cap does not require the Trump administration to resettle 30,000 refugees; as other administrations have accepted far fewer than the cap permits.
