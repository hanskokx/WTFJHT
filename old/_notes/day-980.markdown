1. **The whistleblower complaint regarding Trump and his interactions with Ukraine has been declassified and released to the public**. The full version of the complaint was released to Congress yesterday. The complaint was filed on Aug. 12, and it raises several issues that go beyond Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The House voted 421-0 to release the complaint. Two House members voted present and 10 did not vote.

**More from the complaint:**

* **The whistleblower also raised concerns about how the White House handled records of the conversation**. The whistleblower identified multiple witnesses to potential presidential misconduct who could corroborate their complaint.

* **Senior White House officials intervened to "lock down" all records of the phone call with Zelensky** by placing them on a computer system that is directly managed by the National Security Council Directorate for Intelligence Programs.

* **White House officials told the whistleblower that they were "directed" by White House lawyers to "remove the electronic transcript from the computer system in which such transcripts are typically stored"** and have it "loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature," even though the call "did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective."

* **The whistleblower describes Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani as a "central figure in this effort,"** which includes attempts at "pressuring a foreign country to investigate the President's main domestic political rivals." The complaint adds: "Attorney General William Barr appears to be involved as well."

1. **Trump's part-time envoy for Ukraine helped set up an introduction between Giuliani and Zelensky so they could talk about having Ukraine investigate Joe Biden and his son**. Ambassador Kurt Volker, who also worked at a lobbying firm that continued to represent the Government of Ukraine for almost two years after he started as special envoy, contacted Giuliani and put him "in direct contact" with a top adviser to Zelensky named Andriy Yermak. The two eventually met face-to-face in Spain. Giuliani says he never received a security clearance to meet with Yermak in Spain.

2. **The whistleblower who filed the complaint with the intelligence community's inspector general has agreed to testify about the complaint to lawmakers in Congress**, but only if acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire gives the whistleblower's attorney the proper clearances to accompany their client. "This is a reasonable request that the Committee strongly supports and expects your office to fulfill immediately," Adam Schiff wrote in a letter to Maguire. Lawmakers have not been told the identity of the whistleblower or where the complainant works in the government.
