1. **Three House committees released documents and text messages provided by former American Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker**. The texts show how senior State Department officials coordinated with Giuliani and the Ukrainian president’s top aide to leverage a potential summit between the heads of state on a promise from the Ukrainians to investigate the 2016 presidential election and an energy company that employed Biden's son. The texts also show that officials felt Trump would not agree to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky unless Zelensky publicly promised to launch the investigations. Democrats say the texts are clear evidence that Trump conditioned normal bilateral relations with Ukraine on that country first agreeing "to launch politically motivated investigations."

1. **Ukraine’s top prosecutor said he would review a criminal case involving the owner of a natural gas company that employed Biden's son**. Prosecutor General Ruslan Ryaboshapka said he intended to review 15 cases in all, including high-profile investigations of wealthy Ukrainians like the owner of the natural gas company Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden served on the board until earlier this year. The prosecutor did not say how long his audit would last. Ryaboshapka said at a news conference in Kiev, "the key words were not Biden and not Burisma."
