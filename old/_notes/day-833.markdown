1. **The Justice Department informed the House Judiciary Committee that William Barr will not appear for his scheduled testimony today and that the DOJ will not comply with a subpoena to turn over the full Mueller report to Congress.** A Justice Department spokesperson said the committee's request to have Barr questioned by committee attorneys was "unprecedented and unnecessary," and said the questions should instead come from lawmakers. Barr's refusal to appear increases the chances that the committee will hold him in contempt of Congress. Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said he would give Barr a "day or two" to turn over the full, unredacted Mueller report, but "if good-faith negotiations don’t result in a pledge of compliance . . . the next step is seeking a contempt citation against the attorney general."

2. **Newly obtained emails from ICE and Health and Human Services officials show the Trump administration had no system in place for reuniting thousands of migrant parents and children who were separated from their families at the southern border.** "We have a list of parent alien numbers but no way to link them to children," one email from June 23, 2018 reads. Officials instead resorted to filling out a simple spreadsheet and manually reviewing all of the records associated with the nearly 3,000 families that were separated at the border. On the same day the above email was sent, DHS issued a fact sheet claiming that the "United States government knows the location of all children in its custody and is working to reunite them with their families." The fact sheet asserted that DHS had "a process established to ensure that family members know the location of their children," which included "a central database which HHS and DHS can access and update." At the time, no such database existed. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/emails-show-trump-admin-had-no-way-link-separated-migrant-n1000746))
