1. **Defense Secretary Mark Esper ordered a review of the National Guard deployments in support of U.S. law enforcement in response to the nationwide protests over the murder of George Floyd.** The review is considered standard procedure after any significant operation, and will specifically focus on the Guard's work with federal and local police forces as it relates to the training, organizing, and deployment of National Guard units. Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy will lead the review, which is expected to be completed and submitted to Esper by the end of July. A total of roughly 74,000 National Guard members were activated across the U.S., the largest domestic deployment in recent history.

2. **The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff did not tell the White House that he planned to release a video admitting that it was a mistake for him to appear in a photo-op with Trump outside of St. John's church last week**. Before publishing his pre-recorded apology, during which he declared "I should not have been there," Gen. Mark Milley contacted other high-ranking military officials and former Joint Chiefs, but not the White House. In recent days, Trump has tried to downplay any tension between himself, Mark Esper, and Milley. "If that's the way they feel, I think that's fine," he said. "I have good relationships with the military. I have rebuilt our military." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/11/politics/white-house-milley-apology/index.html))

3. **The Trump administration will rely on a novel reinterpretation of a Cold War-era arms treaty in order to allow U.S. defense contractors to sell more armed drones.** The new interpretation of the 33-year-old Missile Technology Control Regime would allow weapons manufacturers like General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc and Northrop Grumman Corp to sell armed U.S. drones to countries like Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, which has always been forbidden under the treaty. U.S. agencies including the Commerce, Energy, Justice, and Homeland Security departments all approved the new interpretation in May, and the State Department expects to approve the first drone sales under the new interpretation as early as this summer.

4. **Trump will deliver a speech at the Republican National Convention in Jacksonville, FL on Aug. 27.** The convention will take place inside an arena that holds up to 15,000 people, none of whom will be required to wear masks or practice social distancing inside the venue. "Not only does Florida hold a special place in President Trump’s heart as his home state," said an RNC spokesperson, "but it is crucial in the path to victory in 2020. We look forward to bringing this great celebration and economic boon to the Sunshine State in just a few short months." The date of Trump's speech coincides with the 60th anniversary of the infamous "[Ax Handle Saturday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ax_Handle_Saturday)," during which a white mob organized by the Ku Klux Klan attacked a group of mostly black civil rights protesters for sitting at Jacksonville's whites-only lunch counters.

5. **Trump bragged on Twitter that his company didn't ask the federal government for any coronavirus relief funding, even though it did.** The Trump Organization didn’t receive any money from the Paycheck Protection Program, but Trump did ask the federal government, which he runs, to give the Trump International Hotel in D.C., which he still owns, a break on rent when the hotel saw its occupancy rates drop from around 60% to the single digits during the height of the pandemic. It is not clear if the hotel actually received any relief, but the request was made.
