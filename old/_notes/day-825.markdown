1. **Trump said he doesn't want any current or former White House aides to testify to Congress** in the wake of the Mueller report. He said complying with congressional requests was unnecessary and that there was "no reason to go any further, and especially in Congress where itâ€™s very partisan." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-he-is-opposed-to-white-house-aides-testifying-to-congress-deepening-power-struggle-with-hill/2019/04/23/0c7bd8dc-65e0-11e9-8985-4cf30147bdca_story.html?noredirect=on))

2. **A Justice Department filing contradicts Jared Kushner's characterization of Russia's influence campaign in the U.S. as simply "buying some Facebook ads and trying to sow dissent."** The filing describes how the actions of Russian spy Maria Butina contained all the markings of a sophisticated intelligence operation. The filing also argues that it doesn't take a master spy for such an operation to have a significant impact. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/23/jared-kushner-fbi-butina-1288769))

3. **Paul Manafort is now in federal prison.** Manafort was convicted and pleaded guilty in 2018 to multiple charges of fraud, conspiracy, and tax evasion and is serving 7.5 years in a high-security federal prison in Pennsylvania. He is expected to be released on Christmas Day in 2024. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/former-trump-campaign-chair-paul-manafort-now-federal-prison-n997511))

4. **Twitter suspended more than 5,000 pro-Trump bot accounts for "platform manipulation."** The accounts were connected to a network that is focused on denouncing the Mueller report as a "hoax." They were also connected to other accounts that have been used to spread pro-Saudi messaging on the platform. An investigation into the network is ongoing but it's still unclear who is behind the campaign.
