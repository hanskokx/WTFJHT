1. **The Trump administration plans to make it much easier for energy companies to release methane into the atmosphere.** The EPA plans to weaken an Obama-era requirement that companies monitor and repair methane leaks. The Interior Department is also expected to release the final version of a draft rule that would repeal a restriction on intentional venting and burning of methane by drilling operations. Methane is among the most potent greenhouse gases and is roughly 25 times more effective than carbon dioxide when it comes to trapping heat in the atmosphere.
