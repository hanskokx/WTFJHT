1. **Trump pardoned a former U.S. soldier who was convicted in 2009 of murdering an Iraqi prisoner.** Former Army 1st Lt. Michael Behenna was convicted of unpremeditated murder in a combat zone and sentenced to 25 years in prison before his sentence was reduced to 15 years and he was paroled in 2014. Behenna admitted during his trial that instead of taking a prisoner home as ordered, Behenna took him to a railroad culvert, made him strip, questioned him at gunpoint, and then shot him because Behenna thought he might try to take his gun. Trump issued a full pardon and grant of clemency. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-grants-pardon-man-killed-iraqi-prisoner-62864825))

2. **Trump's top economic advisers accused China of reneging on its promises and said Trump plans to escalate the ongoing trade dispute between the two countries.** Trump is reportedly angry that China pulled back from some of the previous agreements it made and thinks the U.S. economy can handle an extension of the trade war, so he plans to increase tariffs against China by $200 billion on Friday morning. "We’re moving backwards instead of forwards," said top trade adviser Robert Lighthizer, "and in the president’s view that’s not acceptable."

3. **China will not take part in three-way nuclear talks with the U.S. and Russia**, according to a spokesperson for the Chinese government. Trump said on Friday that he spoke with Putin and the Chinese government about a possible three-way deal. "China, I've already spoken to them," Trump said. "They very much would like to be a part of that deal. In fact, during the trade talks, we started talking about that." But the Chinese government publicly denied that it was interested in any such deal. "We oppose any country's attempt to make an issue out of China on arms control and will not participate in any negotiation for a trilateral nuclear disarmament agreement," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang.

4. **New York Attorney General Letitia James' office is suing the Treasury Department and the IRS for failing to respond to legally mandated records requests.** The requests were related to a change in reporting standards which eliminated donor disclosure requirements for donors who give more than $5,000 to non-501(c)(3) tax-exempt groups. The suit alleges that the IRS failed to respond to the requests before the legally mandated deadline. "Not only was this policy change made without notice," James said in a statement, "the Treasury and the IRS are now refusing to comply with the law to release information about the rationale for these changes."
