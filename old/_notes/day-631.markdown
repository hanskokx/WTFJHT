1. **The Turkish government told U.S. officials that they have audio and video recordings that prove Jamal Khashoggi was tortured and killed inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.** The recordings show that Khashoggi was detained inside the consulate by a Saudi security team before being killed and dismembered. “You can hear his voice and the voices of men speaking Arabic” on the audio recording of the incident, one person with knowledge of the recording said. “You can hear how he was interrogated, tortured and then murdered.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/turks-tell-us-officials-they-have-audio-and-video-recordings-that-support-conclusion-khashoggi-was-killed/2018/10/11/119a119e-cd88-11e8-920f-dd52e1ae4570_story.html?utm_term=.7db203fc57e8))

2. **Trump on Khashoggi: "It’s in Turkey, and it’s not a citizen, as I understand it," he said.** "But a thing like that shouldn’t happen.” Later, Trump added: “Again, this took place in Turkey, and to the best of our knowledge, Khashoggi is not a United States citizen. Is that right?” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/11/trumps-jamal-khashoggi-reckoning-why-his-history-with-despots-suggests-he-wont-get-tough-saudi-arabia/?utm_term=.d9521e1bb6ab))

3. **Two Arizona Republicans tried to make a donation to a Democratic congressman as members of the Communist Party in an attempt to link him to the far left.** Two men walked into first-term Democrat Tom O'Halleran with a jar of $39.68 and insisted that the Northern Arizona University Community Party wanted them to get a receipt for the donation. When O'Halleran's finance director drove to the local Republican field office to return the money, one of the men appeared from inside the offices and was identified as the man who tried to donate the money.

4. **Newly released emails show Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross spoke with Steve Bannon and Kris Kobach about adding a citizenship question to the U.S. Census.** Contrary to Ross' originally stated intentions for adding the question, the email reveal that Ross was instead concerned that not adding a citizenship question "leads to the problem that aliens who do not actually 'reside' in the United States are still counted for congressional apportionment purposes." The emails reveal that the political effects of asking about citizenship were indeed part of the original calculus for the decision to include it.
