1. **U.S. intelligence officials warned Trump about the threat of the coronavirus in more than a dozen classified briefings specifically prepared for him in January and February.** The President's Daily Brief is prepared every day before dawn and is designed to highlight the most pressing developments and threats from around the world. Trump received dozens of PDBs over the course of January and February, each of which traced the spread of the virus around the world, warned that China was suppressing information about its virality and death toll, and sounded the alarm about the potentially dire political and economic consequences of the virus. Trump routinely skips reading his PDB and spent the first two months of the year downplaying the severity and threat of the virus.

2. **Attorney General William Barr has directed federal prosecutors to look for state and local coronavirus restrictions that go too far or violate constitutional rights.** Barr instructed the assistant attorney general in charge of the Civil Rights Division, along with all U.S. attorneys, to be "on the lookout for state and local directives that could be violating the constitutional rights and civil liberties of individual citizens." Barr warned that many policies "that would be unthinkable in regular times have become commonplace in recent weeks," and said that although some of the restrictions imposed by state and local governments have been necessary to slow the spread of the virus, "there is no denying that they have imposed tremendous burdens on the daily lives of all Americans."

3. **Trump said he takes no responsibility for any increase in the number of people misusing disinfectants**, despite suggesting that ingesting disinfectant might serve as a coronavirus treatment. When asked about the increase, Trump said he "can't imagine why" people might think it was a potential treatment for the virus. When asked if he takes responsibility, Trump said, "No, I don't."
