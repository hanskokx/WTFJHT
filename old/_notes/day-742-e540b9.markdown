1. **The U.S. will withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.** Russia has been violating the 1987 arms control treaty for more than five years, and the U.S. gave Russia 60 days to return to compliance in December. The treaty prohibits the U.S. and Russia from possessing any land-based cruise missiles with a range of 310 to 3,410 miles.

2. **Senate investigators obtained new information that Trump Jr.'s mysterious phone calls ahead of the 2016 Trump Tower meeting were not with his father.** Records show the calls were between Trump Jr. and two business associates, not with the president, as Democrats have long suspected. Phone records show Trump Jr. had calls with two blocked numbers that day â€” the same day he spoke on the phone with Russian pop star Emin Agalarov, whose father set up the June 2016 meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower.

3. **Billionaire Republican benefactors Sheldon and Miriam Adelson donated $500,000 to a legal defense fund set up to help pay the legal costs of Trump aides who are involved in the Mueller investigation.** Each Adelson gave $250,000 to the fund on Oct. 1, 2018, during the height of the midterm elections. The Adelsons were also the largest contributors to GOP political campaigns and committees, making more than $100 million in donations to Republican candidates.

4. **A pair of Democratic House lawmakers called on acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to revoke Jared Kushner's top secret security clearance.** Kushner's clearance was initially rejected by career security specialists after his background check revealed potential avenues for foreign influence, but the rejections were overridden by a Trump-appointed supervisor. Kushner is just one of at least 30 cases in which the supervisor overruled career security experts and approved clearances for Trump administration officials. Reps. Don Beyer and Ted Lieu sent a letter to Mulvaney urging him to "immediately revoke the security clearance of Senior White House Advisor Jared Kushner."
