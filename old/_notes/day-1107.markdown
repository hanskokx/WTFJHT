1. **Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander says he will vote to dismiss a motion to summon witnesses and call for documents in the Senate impeachment trial**. Alexander acknowledged that it was "inappropriate for the president to ask a foreign leader to investigate his political opponent and to withhold United States aid to encourage that investigation," but says the Constitution doesn't give the Senate the authority to "remove the president from office and ban him from this year’s ballot simply for actions that are inappropriate." The announcement means Democrats' bid to call new witnesses in the trial will likely fall short since Republicans now have the votes to block the motion.

2. **The Trump administration is planning to roll back Obama-era restrictions on the use of landmines by the U.S. military**. The decision is expected as early as Friday. The U.S. prohibits the use of landmines outside of the Korean peninsula, and the push to relax restrictions has been criticized by arms control groups because anti-personnel mines present a danger to civilians long after the conflicts in which they are deployed have ended.

3. **Trump's border wall is likely to require the installation of hundreds of storm gates so it won't be knocked over during flash floods** — gates that must be left open for months every year during "monsoon season" in the desert. These open, unmanned gates in remote areas have already become easy-access points for smugglers and migrants entering the United States.
