1. **The prosecutor personally selected by Attorney General William Barr to investigate the origins of the Mueller probe says he can't find any evidence to support the theory that the probe was a setup by American intelligence agencies**. U.S. Attorney John Durham was contacted by the office of DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz and asked whether a Maltese professor who had early contact with the Trump campaign was actually a U.S. intelligence asset. U.S. intelligence have agencies denied the claim, and Durham informed Horowitz's office that his investigation had also produced no evidence to support it. The previously unreported interaction between Horowitz and Durham is documented in a draft of Horowitz's forthcoming report on the Russia investigation, which argues that the FBI did have sufficient evidence to launch the investigation in the first place.
