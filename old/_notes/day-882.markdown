1. **Iran shot down a U.S. naval surveillance drone**, which it claims violated Iranian airspace. The U.S. military claims the drone was in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. Each side accused the other of being the aggressor. Both sides said the drone was shot down at 7:35 p.m. ET on Wednesday.

2. **Russian-born real estate developer Felix Sater will testify before the House Intelligence Committee tomorrow** to answer questions about his experience working on the proposed Trump Tower Moscow. The closed-door interview is part of House Democrats' investigation into Trump's plans to expand his business operations in Russia during the 2016 election. Sater is a U.S. citizen who worked on two separate efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. He was originally scheduled to testify in March, but his appearance was postponed.

3. **Trump told people close to him that he thinks he has the authority to replace Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board**. Trump believes he can demote Powell and make him a board governor, but said he isn't planning to do so at the moment. Earlier this year, Trump asked White House lawyers to explore his options for removing Powell, and Trump has privately expressed his frustration with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's decision to pick Powell as chair in the first place.

4. **Deutsche Bank is being investigated by federal authorities over questions of whether it complied with anti-money-laundering laws**. Investigators will review the bank's handling of suspicious activity reports about potentially problematic transactions, including some linked to Jared Kushner. The criminal investigation is one part of several separate but overlapping government probes into financial corruption and the flow of illicit funds through the U.S. financial system. Several other banks are also under investigation. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/business/deutsche-bank-money-laundering-trump.html))

5. **Three more U.S. senators received a classified Pentagon briefing about a series of reported Navy encounters with UFOs**. A growing number of members from key oversight committees have requested similar briefings. Sen. Mark Warner was one of the latest three to be briefed on what Warner's spokesperson referred to as an "unidentified aerial phenomenon." The briefing comes several days after Trump claimed he had also been briefed on the reports. "People are saying theyâ€™re seeing UFOs," Trump told ABC News. "Do I believe it? Not particularly."
