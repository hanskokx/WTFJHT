1. **Trump played a direct role in setting up the arrangement between his golf resort in Scotland and officials at Glasgow Prestwick Airport**, the goal of which was to increase private and commercial air traffic to the region. Trump said yesterday that the deal had "NOTHING TO DO WITH ME," but documents show both Trump and the Trump Organization were directly involved in crafting the partnership. The Trump Organization worked to get Trump's resort onto a list of hotels that Prestwick would routinely send aircrews to, even though Turnberry is 20 miles from the airport, farther away than many other hotels, and has higher advertised prices.

2. **Trump said he plans to release an "extremely complete" report of his financial records**. In response to questions from reporters about several documented instances of U.S. Air Force personnel staying at his Turnberry resort in Scotland, Trump said it was unfair to suggest that he played any part in the arrangement because he owns so many different properties. We will learn more about his "financial condition" soon, Trump continued, "because I will be, at some point prior to the election, I will be giving out a financial report of me. And it will be extremely complete." He offered no specifics about the report, nor did he give a clear timeline of when he plans to release it.

3. **Trump fired his national security adviser John Bolton**. "I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House," Trump tweeted. Bolton offered a slightly different version of events shortly after Trump made the announcement. "I offered to resign last night," Bolton tweeted, "and President Trump said, 'Letâ€™s talk about it tomorrow.'" Bolton is the third person to have served as Trump's national security adviser since his election. The two have had a series of disagreements during Bolton's tenure, including over how to handle sensitive foreign policy matters involving North Korea, Afghanistan, and Iran. Trump did not name Bolton's successor but said he plans to appoint someone "next week."
