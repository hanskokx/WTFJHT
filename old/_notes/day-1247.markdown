1. **A senior official who has served in the State Department since Trump's first day in office resigned her post over Trump's handling of racial tensions in the U.S.** Mary Elizabeth Taylor stepped down as Trump's assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs on Thursday, citing Trump's "comments and actions surrounding racial injustice and Black Americans cut sharply against my core values and convictions." Taylor is a lifelong member of the Republican party, has previously worked for Mitch McConnell, was unanimously confirmed to her position in October 2018, is the youngest assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs in U.S. history, and is the first black woman to serve in that position.

2. **One of the most prominent and respected policy officials at the Pentagon resigned her post after she was passed over for a nomination to a senior intelligence position at the Department of Defense.** Kathryn Wheelbarger is stepping down after serving for three years in the Trump administration after Trump dropped his plans to nominate her to the position of deputy under secretary of defense for intelligence and instead nominated Bradley Hansell, a former special assistant to Trump. In her resignation letter, Wheelbarger said she believed her colleagues would "continue to be guided by the U.S. Constitution and the principles of our founding, which ensure both our security and our freedom." Current and former U.S. officials have accused the White House of passing over Wheelbarger because of her previous work with the late Sen. John McCain, whom Trump frequently clashed with during McCain's tenure in the Senate and after his death.

3. **The acting senior director for European and Russian Affairs at the National Security Council is stepping down and will return to his previous position at the Pentagon.** Tom Williams was Trump's fourth Russia director at the NSC in three years. His predecessor, Andrew Peek, was placed on administrative leave pending a security review back in January. The other two, Fiona Hill and Tim Morrison, testified as part of the House impeachment inquiry into Trump's dealings with Ukraine. National security adviser Robert O'Brien says Williams is returning to the Pentagon "after two years of service detailed to the NSC," which he said is "customary."

4. **The Air Force inspector general is investigating whether the U.S. military improperly used a reconnaissance drone to monitor protests in Washington and Minneapolis earlier this month.** The investigation was launched after lawmakers raised concerns that the use of the military surveillance aircraft may have violated the civil rights of the protesters demonstrating against police killings of Black men in Minneapolis and across the U.S. A spokesperson for the Air Force confirmed that the secretary of the Air Force is "conducting an investigation into the use of Air National Guard RC-26 aircraft to support civil authorities during recent protest activity in U.S. cities," but declined to answer any other questions about the probe.

5. **Twitter labeled one of Trump's tweets as "manipulated media" after he shared an edited version of a viral video from 2019, which showed one Black toddler and one white toddler greeting and hugging each other.** Trump's version of the video included ominous background music and a fake CNN chyron that reads, "Terrified toddler runs from racist baby." A subsequent chyron reads, "Racist baby probably a Trump voter." A spokesperson for Twitter said in a statement that the tweet was labeled "per our synthetic and manipulated media policy to give people more context." This is the third time Twitter has taken action against one of Trump's tweets.

6. **The Trump campaign still hasn't distributed a plan to protect people who attend Trump's rally in Tulsa on Saturday from contracting the coronavirus.** A spokesperson for the 19,000-seat BOK Center said the venue has asked the Trump campaign to provide them with "a written plan detailing the steps the event will institute for health and safety, including those related to social distancing" so it can share the plan with local health officials, but the campaign has yet to deliver. The Trump campaign is requiring all rally attendees to sign a waiver absolving the campaign and venue of liability if they contract COVID-19, but it is unclear whether event staff will also have to sign the waiver or whether there is a plan to protect the employees who will be working at the event.
