1. **Deputy White House counsel John Eisenberg moved the transcript of Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to a highly classified server after Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman raised concerns about Trump's behavior on the call**. According to people familiar with Vindman's closed-door testimony this week, Vindman had been listening in on the call and told Eisenberg after the call that it was over. He further said that what Trump did was wrong and that he was disturbed by the pressure Trump had put on Zelensky to investigate Trump's political rivals. It was only after Vindman raised these concerns that Eisenberg recommended restricting access to a transcript of the call by placing it in a highly classified server. Vindman’s account marks the first known instance of an impeachment witness providing a firsthand account that ties Eisenberg to the decision to move the transcript to the more secure server.

2. **The top Russia and Europe adviser on the National Security Council is expected to corroborate the testimony of Ambassador Bill Taylor**, who says Trump tried to use his office to pressure Ukraine into launching an investigation into Trump's political rivals. Tim Morrison is expected to testify that he told Taylor about Trump and his deputies' push to withhold U.S. security aid to Ukraine and a meeting between Trump and Zelensky until Ukraine announced an investigation into the Bidens and interference in the 2016 election. Morrison will also say that he didn't view Trump's actions as improper or illegal, but he did see them as problematic for U.S. foreign policy efforts in the region. Morrison's testimony comes a day after he announced that he will be leaving the Trump administration.

3. **Democrats in the House are preparing for a vote to approve the ground rules they will use when they impeach Trump**. Democrats have the votes to approve the eight pages of procedures, with only a few defectors expected from each party. Republican lawmakers say the process has been secretive and slanted against them, while Democrats say they have simply been following the same procedures used during the impeachment efforts against Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.

* **The full Trump-Ukraine timeline.** The House is engaged in a formal impeachment inquiry of Trump. It's focused on his efforts to secure specific investigations in Ukraine that carried political benefits for him — with indications that there might have been an explicit or implicit quid pro quo involved.
