1. **Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Paul Gosar will self-quarantine after coming into contact with a person who has the coronavirus at the CPAC, where Trump, Mike Pence and Mike Pompeo all spoke.** Cruz said he would self-quarantine for 14 days after a "brief conversation and a handshake" with the individual, while Gosar will do the same and close his office for a week after interacting with the individual "for an extended period of time, and we shook hands several times." Trump, meanwhile, was photographed shaking hands with the chairman of the American Conservative Union, who confirmed that he had also been in direct contact with the infected man during CPAC last month.

* **How the Trump administration lost control of the coronavirus crisis.** This portrait of the precious weeks that Trump and his administration frittered away in trying to deal with the coronavirus is the result of interviews with 16 current and former administration officials, state health officials and outside experts, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to share candid assessments.

1. **The White House overruled health officials who wanted to tell seniors and physically fragile to avoid flying on commercial airlines because of the coronavirus**. The CDC originally submitted a plan to make the announcement as a way of trying to control the virus, but the White House ordered the air travel language removed from from the plan. Since then, the Trump administration has issued guidance that certain people should not be traveling, but has not gone as far as the CDC initially recommended. Administration officials pushed back, calling it "complete fiction" and saying "it was never a recommendation to the Task Force."

2. **The 10-year Treasury yield continued to fall this week due to an ongoing oil price war and contagion fears surrounding the coronavirus.** The yield has now slid to an all-time low of 0.318%. The 10-year yield serves as benchmark for mortgage rates and auto loans and holds outsized importance in the U.S economy. The 30-year Treasury yield also hit a record low of 0.702%, breaching the 1% threshold for the first time in history. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/09/10-year-treasury-yield-plunges.html))

3. **An altered video of Joe Biden shared by the White House and retweeted by Trump has been flagged as "manipulated media" by Twitter.** It's the first test of the new policy implemented on March 5 to label tweets that include manipulated or synthetic content, which includes everything from edited videos to full "deep fakes" of things that never actually happened. The altered video of Biden shows him stumbling through one of his lines during a speech, but cuts off after Biden accidentally says, "Excuse me. We can only re-elect Donald Trump." The video leaves out the rest of the quote: "We can only reelect Donald Trump if in fact we get engaged in this circular firing squad here. Itâ€™s gotta be a positive campaign."
