1. **The Trump administration imposed new tariffs on a record $7.5 billion worth of goods from the European Union**, including Airbus, French wines, and Scottish whiskies. The tariffs went into effect just after midnight after talks between U.S. and European trade negotiators failed to reach a deal. Civilian aircraft will now cost 10% more when imported to the U.S., while the cost of wine, olives, certain cheeses, butter, and other consumer goods will also rise.

2. **The Kurds say Turkey is violating the ceasefire brokered by the U.S. in northeastern Syria**.

SDF leaders say the Turkish military and the Syrian rebel forces supporting them have hit a number of civilian areas, including a hospital.
