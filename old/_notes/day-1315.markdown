1. **The RNC pulled one of its scheduled speakers after she urged her followers on Twitter to investigate a supposed Jewish plot to enslave the world.** Mary Ann Mendoza is a member of the Trump campaign's advisory board. She tweeted, "Do yourself a favor and read this thread,” to her more than 40,000 followers Tuesday morning. The thread she shared claimed that the Rothschilds—a famous Jewish banking family from Germany—created a plot to terrorize non-Jewish "goyim," that included plans to "make the goyim destroy each other" and "rob the goyim of their landed properties." The thread was full of references to the internet conspiracy, QAnon, and used a slew of anti-Semitic hoaxes and smears to claim that malevolent Jewish forces in the banking industry are out to enslave non-Jews and promote world wars. The thread also promoted “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,” an anti-Semitic hoax popular in Nazi Germany. Mendoza later deleted her tweet and posted an apology "for not paying attention to the intent of the whole message."

2. **Trump hosted naturalization ceremony during the second night of the Republican National Convention, raising questions about whether the ceremony violated a criminal provision of the Hatch Act.** Acting Homeland Security secretary Chad Wolf administered the Oath of Allegiance for five new citizens during the pre-taped ceremony, which was presented as part of the convention's prime-time programming. The event appeared to be designed as part of the convention, which would be a violation of the Hatch Act. Under the act, executive branch employees are prohibited from using their authority or office to influence the election of a presidential candidate. A White House official claimed the event was part of Trump's official schedule that was publicized on a public website, and that the campaign "decided to use the publicly available content for campaign purposes. There was no violation of law." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hatch-act-republican-convention/2020/08/25/53b72b44-e6f8-11ea-970a-64c73a1c2392_story.html))

3. **People who attended Melania Trump's Rose Garden speech at the RNC were not required to get tested for COVID-19.** A person who attended the speech said there were screening questions on the RSVP form, but no actual coronavirus tests or temperature checks were required or conducted at the White House. The Trump campaign about 70 people were expected to attend the speech, which was the first to have an in-person audience. Melania's chief of staff Stephanie Grisham said audience members "in the rows near the President and vice president" were tested for coronavirus before the speech, but most of the guests were not, especially those "in the last five or six rows." Most of the attendees also did not wear masks, and the chairs provided for attendees were not spaced six feet apart.
