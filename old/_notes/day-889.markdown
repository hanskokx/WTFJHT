1. **Last night was the first of two back-to-back Democratic presidential primary debates**, featuring 10 candidates and 5 moderators. The debate centered around a handful of major topics, including healthcare, guns, immigration, climate change, Iran, and others. Trump was surprisingly absent from most of the discussion, with candidates opting instead to talk more about their respective policies and positions than Trump's presidency. The second debate begins tonight at 9 p.m. ET and will feature another 10 candidates. Instead of giving you a breakdown of last night's entire two-hour ordeal, here's a look at how some of the major outlets are covering it:

1. **Trump demanded that India withdraw its latest tariff hike on 28 U.S. products**. India imposed the tariffs in response to Trump's decision to remove key trade privileges for New Delhi. Trump called the tariffs "unacceptable," and tweeted that he's looking forward to "to speaking with Prime Minister Modi about the fact that India, for years having put very high tariffs against the United States, just recently increased the tariffs even further." Trump is expected to meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at this week's G20 Summit in Japan.

2. **Trump marked his arrival in Japan for the G20 Summit by lashing out at U.S. allies**. He complained that if the U.S. were attacked, Japan would simply "watch it on a Sony television" instead of coming to America's defense. He called Germany a security freeloader, and he complained about India's new tariffs on U.S. goods. Trump is scheduled to meet with the leaders of all three countries on Friday. Trump did not, however, have anything negative to say about the fourth world leader on his meeting schedule for Friday: Vladimir Putin of Russia. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/world/asia/trump-g20.html))

3. **Trump told reporters that what he says to Putin in private is "none of your business," when asked what the two world leaders will discuss behind closed doors at the G20 Summit**. "I will have a very good conversation with him," Trump said. "What I say to him is none of your business." Trump is scheduled to meet with Putin on Friday, just as House Democrats are demanding to hear from the White House records chief about allegations that Trump tried to conceal documents that detail his previous private conversations with Putin.

4. **Two women in whom E. Jean Carroll confided about her alleged sexual assault by Trump spoke publicly about the incident for the first time**. Carol Martin and Lisa Birnbach came forward to talk about the advice they gave Carroll at the time. Neither of the women had been publicly identified until now, and it was the first time since the alleged assault that they had discussed the incident together. Trump denies Carroll's allegations and says she is "totally lying." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/jean-carroll-trump-sexual-assault.html))
