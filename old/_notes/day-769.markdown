üö® **Michael Cohen's public testimony is happening now, where he is expected to publicly accuse Trump and present documents before the House Oversight Committee that prove Trump engaged in "criminal conduct" while in office**. Cohen is also expected to testify that Trump knew ahead of time about WikiLeaks' plan to release DNC emails that were intended to damage Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, saying Roger Stone told Trump in a July 2016 phone call that "he had just gotten off the phone with \[WikiLeaks founder\] Julian Assange and that ‚Ä¶within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton's campaign." Cohen will also testify that Trump "asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair" with $130,000 of his own money weeks before the 2016 election "to avoid any money being traced back to him that could negatively impact his campaign."

1. **Trump met with Kim Jong-Un yesterday in the capital of Vietnam for the first day of his second summit with the North Korean dictator.** Trump called Kim a "great leader" and promised to help North Korea to become a "great economic power." At a dinner between the two men, Trump said he believes the summit will "lead to a wonderful, really a wonderful situation long term."

2. **Former acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker has agreed to return to Congress and meet with lawmakers behind closed doors to "clarify" parts of his previous public testimony**, during which he claimed he never made "any promises or commitments concerning the special counsel's investigation or any other investigation" to Trump. The House Judiciary Committee, however, believes it has evidence that Trump asked Whitaker while he was acting AG whether he could install a Trump ally to oversee the investigation into Michael Cohen.
