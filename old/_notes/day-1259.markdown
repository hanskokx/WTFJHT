1. **A federal judge overturned the Trump administration's 2019 policy that prohibited immigrants from claiming asylum in the U.S. if they didn't attempt to claim it in a country they passed through on the way to the U.S. border.** U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly of Washington, D.C. ruled that the so-called "third-country asylum rule" violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, and that the administration failed to abide by the Administrative Procedure Act when adopting the policy. The INA allows anyone who has made it to U.S. soil to apply for asylum, with some exceptions, and the APA requires that Americans be given enough time and opportunity to weigh in on certain rule changes. Judge Kelly was appointed to the federal bench by Trump in 2017. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/judge-overturns-trump-border-rule-requiring-immigrants-first-claim-asylum-n1232629))

3. **The U.S. bought up virtually the entire global stock of one of the two drugs that have been proven to work against COVID-19, leaving the rest of the world unable to purchase it for at least the next three months.** Remdesivir is the first drug to be approved by licensing authorities in the U.S. to treat COVID-19. It is made by drug manufacturer Gilead and has been shown to help people recover faster from the disease. The Trump administration bought more than 500,000 doses of Remdesivir, which is Gilead's entire stock for July and 90% of the supply for August and September.

4. **Trump called reports that Russia offered bounties to Taliban fighters who kill American and coalition forces a "HOAX!"** He also claimed the story "is just another made up by Fake News tale that is told only to damage me and the Republican Party." In a later tweet, Trump repeated his claim that he was never briefed about the bounty program by intelligence officials "because any info that they may have had did not rise to that level."

5. **Trump said he plans to veto this year's proposed $740 billion defense spending bill if it includes an amendment that would require the Pentagon to rename military bases named after Confederate generals and military leaders.** Trump tweeted: "I will Veto the Defense Authorization Bill if the Elizabeth ‘Pocahontas’ Warren (of all people!) Amendment, which will lead to the renaming (plus other bad things!) of Fort Bragg, Fort Robert E. Lee, and many other Military Bases from which we won Two World Wars, is in the Bill!" The amendment would change the names of 10 U.S. military bases named after Confederate generals and require the removal of Confederate likenesses, symbols and paraphernalia from defense facilities across the country within three years.
