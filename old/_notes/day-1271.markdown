1. **Trump commuted the jail sentence of his longtime friend and confidant Roger Stone on Friday.** Stone was convicted in 2019 of seven felonies and was scheduled to begin his 40-month prison sentence on Tuesday. The White House released a lengthy written statement denouncing "overzealous prosecutors" who convicted Stone on "process-based charges" as a result of the "witch hunts" as part of the "Russia hoax" investigation. The letter does not argue that Stone is innocent, only that he should not have been investigated in the first place. The commutation was announced shortly after Stone's attempt to appeal his sentence was dismissed by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.

2. **The White House is looking to discredit Dr. Anthony Fauci and stop him from making additional statements about the dangers of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.** A White House official said several officials in the Trump administration are "concerned about the number of times Dr. Fauci has been wrong on things." The official cited, among others, Fauci's comments in January that the coronavirus was "not a major threat" and his guidance in March that "people should not be walking around with masks." The scientific and medical consensus on how to respond to the virus has evolved over time, both in the U.S. and around the world. Many of Fauci's "wrong" statements highlighted by the White House official were based on the best available data at the time and were widely echoed by Trump, other members of the coronavirus task force, and senior White House officials.

3. **Two top health officials in the Trump administration acknowledged that they "do expect deaths to go up" in the U.S. as coronavirus cases continue to skyrocket in parts of the country.** Admiral Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary with the Health and Human Services department, and surgeon general Dr. Jerome Adams both emphasized their concerns about the surging outbreaks, many of which are occurring in areas where people haven't followed the recommendations from the CDC on how to limit the spread. "We’re all very concerned about the rise in cases, no doubt about that," said Adm. Giroir, who has been in charge of the Trump administration's testing response. "We do expect deaths to go up. If you have more cases, more hospitalizations, we do expect to see that over the next two or three weeks before this turns around."

4. **China announced retaliatory sanctions against U.S. officials in response to U.S. sanctions over Beijing's treatment of Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities in China's Xinjiang Province.** Among the U.S. officials and organizations named in the sanctions are Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, Rep. Chris Smith, Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback, and the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. A spokesperson for China announced the sanctions at a press conference on Monday, calling on the U.S. to "stop interfering in China's international affairs." The U.S. sanctions against Chinese officials include the freezing of all US assets and a block preventing US nationals from conducting business with them. "We urge the US to immediately withdraw its wrong decision and stop interfering in China's internal affairs or undermining China's interests," the spokesperson said.

5. **Trump claimed that "nobody ever heard" that Abraham Lincoln was a member of the Republican Party before Trump became president.** "Like people don’t remember, nobody ever heard of it until I came along, nobody remembered it for a long time, or they didn’t use it at least, I use it all the time: Abraham Lincoln was a Republican," Trump said. He added: "You know you say that and people say, 'I didn’t know that,' but he was Republican, so we’re doing a great job."
