1. **Top White House officials were aware in early 2019 of a Russian bounty program to pay Taliban fighters to kill U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan, a year earlier than previously reported.** The intelligence was presented in at least one of Trump's daily written briefings at the time. Then-national security adviser John Bolton also said he briefed Trump in March 2019. The White House continues to insist that Trump was not and has not been briefed on the matter to this day, but two officials say the information was included in the President's Daily Brief in late February 2020. The CIA also felt the information was serious enough to distribute across the intelligence community in a May 4 article of the CIA's World Intelligence Review.

2. **Republicans have skipped all but one of both the public and private House Intelligence Committee meetings the last several months.** Democrats claim Republicans are boycotting the sessions out of partisan spite, while Republicans say they have legitimate concerns about the security of the virtual sessions. The committee has held at least seven bipartisan open- and closed-door sessions since the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. in March. The only time a Republican member of the committee attended one of the unclassified sessions was on April 28, when then-Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas attended a week before the Senate hearing on his nomination to become Trump's director of national intelligence.

3. **The chair of the House's select committee on the coronavirus says he will not recognize members who refuse to wear a mask while the committee is in session.** Rep. James Clyburn wrote a letter announcing the policy after every Republican on the committee refused to wear a mask at a hearing last Friday, despite being warned to do so beforehand. Clyburn also said members who prefer to not wear masks can participate remotely. "Going forward," the letter reads, "as long as the Attending Physician’s requirement to wear masks is in place, I will not recognize any member of this Subcommittee to participate in person in any Subcommittee meeting or hearing unless the member is wearing a mask and strictly adheres to the Attending Physician’s guidance."
