1. **The Department of Veterans Affairs told congressional staffers that it will not reimburse veterans who were paid less than they were owed as a result of delayed or deferred GI Bill payments.** VA officials promised the opposite earlier this month. The VA said it can't make the payments it owes without auditing its previous education claims because that would delay future payments.

2. **Trump says he won't take a pardon for Manafort off the table.** "It was never discussed," Trump said during an interview in the Oval Office, "but I wouldnâ€™t take it off the table. Why would I take it off the table?" He also accused Mueller and his team asked Manafort, Roger Stone, and Jerome Corsi to lie. "If you told the truth, you go to jail," Trump said.

3. **Trump made several calls from a blocked number in the middle of the night to Roger Stone during the 2016 campaign.** The call logs were turned over to the special counsel, and Mueller's interest in them was laid out in a draft court document. The document revealed that prosecutors have drawn a direct line between Stone and Trump, a revelation that rattled Trump's legal team and showed how closely the special counsel is scrutinizing their relationship.
