1. **Deutsche Bank loaned more than $2 billion to Trump over the course of multiple decades during his time as a real estate developer**, even when other banks wouldn't touch him. The bank repeatedly loaned money to Trump despite multiple business-related "red flags." Trump often exaggerated his wealth to the tune of an extra $2 billion in order to secure additional loans from the bank. In 2010, Trump returned to Deutsche Bank for a loan of $100 million and the bank gave it to him, even though it had concluded at the time that Trump had overvalued some of his real estate assets by up to 70%.

2. **Devin Nunes is suing Twitter and three users for $250 million for defamation.** Nunes claims users on Twitter made fun of him and accused him of crimes, something Nunes says "no human being should ever have to bear and suffer in their whole life." Nunes cited a wide range of tweets that accuse him of criminal misconduct, make jokes about him and criticism his actions as a lawmaker. One Twitter user claimed that Nunes was voted "Most Likely to Commit Treason" in high school. Nunes' lawsuit names GOP strategist Liz Mair and two parody accounts: @DevinNunesMom, which was suspended in 2018, and @DevinCow, or "Devin Nunes' cow." He claims the accounts defamed him and Twitter allowed it to happen.

3. **The Trump administration proposed placing a cap on federal student loan borrowing** in order to help curb the cost of higher education. The plan is to prevent borrowers from taking out too many federal loans to the point where the debt becomes unmanageable. The proposal also calls for combining five loan repayment options into one plan that would cap monthly payments at 12.5% of a borrowers discretionary income.

4. **Congressional Democrats asked the FBI to investigate the owner of the Florida massage parlor chain who is alleged to have connections to Trump.** Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer released a letter signed by four other lawmakers calling on federal agents to investigate "public reports about alleged activities by Ms. Li ‘Cindy’ Yang and her apparent relationship with the president." The letter also calls on the FBI to investigate whether another company started by Yang "may be selling access to the president and members of his family to clients from China." Yang's attorney says she denies the allegations against her. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-massageparlors-idUSKCN1QZ2MV))

5. **A federal appeals court will hear arguments in a case challenging Trump's ownership of a luxury hotel down the street from the White House.** The case represents the highest level hearing yet for a lawsuit that claims Trump's vast holdings are a conflict of interest between his businesses and his duties as president. The suit accuses Trump of violating the emoluments clause in the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits the president from receiving "any present, emolument, office or title of any kind whatever from any king, prince or foreign state" or any U.S. state while in office.
