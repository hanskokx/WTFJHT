1. **A federal judge is considering a request by the Justice Department to dismiss a criminal charge against Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn.** Flynn pleaded guilty twice to lying to the FBI about his conversations with then-Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia. The government is arguing that Flynn was set up and the case should therefore be dropped. The court directed U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan in May to drop the criminal charge against Flynn, but Sullivan asked the court for a re-hearing of the case. On August 31, the appellate court overturned the prior order, saying Sullivan has the authority to arguments from both sides.

2. **House Democrats released a new $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief proposal.** The bill is $200 billion smaller than the Democrats' most recent proposal, and down from the $3.4 trillion measure passed by the House largely along party lines in May. The latest proposal includes funding for schools, small businesses, restaurants, airline workers, and more. It also earmarks $75 billion in funding for coronavirus testing, contact tracing, and isolation measures "with special attention to the disparities facing communities of color." It includes a second round of $1,200 payments per taxpayer and $500 per dependent, while extending weekly $600 federal unemployment payments through January 2021. It also comes with $436 billion to help state, local, territorial and tribal governments pay first responders and health workers.

3. **Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced that 2020 Census will end on Oct. 5, despite a federal judge's ruling that allows the count to continue until Oct. 31.** A tweet from the official U.S. Census Bureau account says the agency will "conclude 2020 Census self-response and field data collection operations" on Oct. 5. U.S. District Court Judge Lucy Koh said she was "disturbed" that "despite the courtâ€™s order," Census supervisors have told field workers to wrap up data collection early. Judge Koh set a deadline of Tuesday for the Commerce Department to produce the administrative record of the decision-making behind Ross' announcement. She also threatened to hold government lawyers in contempt of court if the deadline isn't met.
