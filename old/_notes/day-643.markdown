1. **Pipe bombs were sent to Hillary Clinton's home in New York, Barack Obama's home in Washington, DC, and CNN's offices in New York City.** Law enforcement officials said the three devices were similar to the one found outside billionaire George Soros' home earlier this week. The device sent to CNN's office was addressed to former CIA director John Brennan and the return address listed former DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said his office also received a device in the mail, but it's not clear if it is related to the pipe bombs. "These terrorizing acts are despicable, and anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law," the White House said in a statement. "The United States Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are investigating and will take all appropriate actions to protect anyone threatened by these cowards."

2. **China is planning to wean its farmers off U.S. soybeans in response to a soybean shortage stemming from the ongoing trade dispute between the two countries.** China is the biggest buyer of soybeans in the world and uses them as a source of protein for its livestock. More than a third of China's soybeans currently come from the United States. "It's directly linked to the US-China trade war," according to the director of the ChinaAg research firm in Taiwan. "The implication is that China will completely halt all future imports of US soybeans." ([CNN Business](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/24/economy/china-soybeans-trade-war/index.html))
