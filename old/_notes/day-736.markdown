1. **Roger Stone was arrested in Florida on seven counts including witness tampering, obstruction of justice, and making false statements to Congress.** Stone was Trump's longtime informal political adviser and is alleged to have been in contact with top-ranking campaign officials about plans to leak information about Hillary Clinton just before the 2016 presidential election. FBI agents were also seen carrying hard drives and other evidence from Stone's apartment in Harlem. Stone's attorney called the charges "ridiculous" and said this was "all about a minor charge about lying to Congress about something that was apparently found later."

2. **A Trump appointee approved Jared Kushner's top secret security clearance application after it was initially rejected by two career White House security specialists** because Kushner's background check included concerns about potential foreign influence over him. The supervisor, Carl Kline, also overruled the recommendations of career security specialists and approved top secret security clearances for at least 30 incoming Trump officials, despite unfavorable information. Kline is a former Pentagon employee who was appointed by Trump in May 2017 as director of the personnel security office in the Executive Office of the President. Only one such clearance rejection had been overruled during the three years before Kline arrived.

3. **The United Nations special rapporteur for extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions will lead the investigation into the killing of Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey.** Agnès Callamard will "review and evaluate, from a human rights perspective, the circumstances surrounding the killing of Khashoggi" and will "will assess the steps taken by governments to address and respond to the killing, and the nature and extent of states’ and individuals’ responsibilities for the killing." The inquiry is not the kind of formal, independent investigation that the U.N. has launched in the past, like the investigation into the death of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan in 2007, but it could lead to a more thorough U.N. examination of the case.
