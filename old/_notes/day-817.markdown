1. **The House Intelligence and Financial Services committees subpoenaed Trump's longtime bank, Deutsche Bank, looking for Trump's personal and financial records.** The two committees also demanded documents related to possible money-laundering by people in Russia and Eastern Europe from financial organizations such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup. Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters said the committee was "exploring these matters, including as they may involve the president and his associates," and that they plan to "follow the facts wherever they may lead us." The Trump Organization said the company is trying to figure out how it might block Deutsche Bank from complying with the subpoena.

2. **The Interior Department's inspector general opened a formal investigation into ethics complaints made against the agency's new secretary, former oil and agribusiness lobbyist David Bernhardt.** Eight Democratic senators and four government ethics watchdog groups have called for an investigation into Bernhardt's conduct, including allegations that he used his position to advance a policy pushed by one of his former lobbying clients and that he intervened to block the release of scientific report about the harmful effects of a chemical pesticide on certain endangered species. In total, the IG's office at the Interior Department received seven complaints from "a wide assortment of complainants alleging various conflicts of interest and other violations" by Bernhardt.

3. **The Department of Justice refused to release sealed and redacted records related to Paul Manafort's case because they are related to "ongoing investigations" by other offices**, even though Mueller's investigation is over. The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia argued in a court filing that, "Although the Special Counsel has concluded his work, he has also referred a number of matters to other offices."
