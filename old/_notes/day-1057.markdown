1. **Senate Republicans are pushing for a short impeachment trial that would include calling zero witnesses**. The plan contradicts Trump's calls to stage a more theatrical trial and public defense of his conduct by calling multiple witnesses, including Joe and Hunter Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and the anonymous whistleblower whose complaint about Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky served as the catalyst for the impeachment inquiry.

2. **Mike Pence's counsel rejected a request from House Democrats to declassify the details of a Sept. 18 call between Pence and Ukrainian President Zelensky**. In a letter to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Pence's attorney claimed the request was illegitimate and said it "serves no purpose" because the impeachment inquiry is already over.

3. **The White House Office of Management and Budget claims in a new memo that it withheld U.S. military aid to Ukraine as a temporary exploratory measure** â€“ not as part of a political effort to override Congress' appropriation of the money. The OMB memo asserts that the office withheld the aid as a way of studying whether the spending complied with U.S. policy. The new memo says OMB extended the hold on the aid eight times in August and September until finally releasing the aid almost immediately after the last hold on September 10.

4. **The internal watchdog for the Defense Department will review a $400 million border wall construction contract awarded to a company that members of the Trump administration have publicly and privately endorsed**. Fisher Sand & Gravel was awarded the contract despite the fact that its proposal "did not meet the operational requirements of U.S. Customs and Border Protection." The Pentagon's IG also said he has "concerns about the possibility of inappropriate influence" exerted on the Army Corps of Engineers by members of the Trump administration.

5. **An associate of Rudy Giuliani's received $1 million from a Russian account in September, a month before he was charged with conspiring to funnel foreign money into U.S. elections**. Lev Parnas spent most of that money "on personal expenses and to purchase a home," according to a recent court filing. The money came during the same month that Parnas and his partner Igor Fruman received the first request for documents from the Congressional committees investigating the Trump administration's actions in Ukraine. The money was deposited into an account in Parnas' wife's name. Federal prosecutors asked a judge to jail Parnas for understating his income and assets.
