1. **A Washington Post photographer captured a picture of the talking points Trump was given for Wednesday's listening session with survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, FL.** The visible side of the piece of paper in Trump's hands had five questions and statements on it, including “What would you most want me to know about your experience?” and a reminder for Trump to say "I hear you."

2. **National security adviser H. R. McMaster could leave the White House** after months of personal tension between McMaster and Trump. The Pentagon is quietly conducting a search to find a "four-star military job suited for McMaster." This is not the first time that speculation over the future of McMaster's role in the Trump administration has been floated.

3. **Melania Trump's parents may have relied on the same process of "chain migration" that Trump has been publicly calling on Congress to end.** Melania's parents are lawful permanent residents of the United States and are reportedly close to obtaining their citizenship.

4. **Republican Congresswoman Claudia Tenney of New York said during a radio interview yesterday that "it's interesting that so many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats** … but the media doesn’t talk about that either." Tenney did not provide any evidence to back up her claim. She is currently the incumbent for a hotly-contested congressional seat in Central New York.

5. **The United States Embassy in Montenegro was attacked yesterday by a man who attempted to throw an explosive device onto the grounds of the embassy, but killed himself instead.** The man threw the explosive object over the wall and onto the embassy property. The blast killed the assailant but did not injure anyone else or cause any major property damage. A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said they did not know the motive of the attack.
