1. **Mike Pence says he "should have worn a mask" during his visit to the Mayo Clinic last week.** During a Fox News town hall, Pence said he "didn't think it was necessary" at the time, but he decided to wear one "when I visited the ventilator plant in Indiana" two days later. Pence said he thought that since he is constantly tested for the virus, wearing a mask wouldn't be necessary because the masks are only meant to prevent people who have the virus from spreading it. The reversal comes after Pence faced widespread public backlash for not wearing the mask at the Minnesota-based medical clinic.

2. **The Chinese government covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in China because it wanted to buy time to stock up on the medical supplies needed to respond to the virus**, according to a report from the Department of Homeland Security. The report says Chinese leaders "intentionally concealed the severity" of the pandemic, and how contagious the virus is, in early January while simultaneously increasing imports and decreasing exports of medical supplies. They attempted to cover their tracks by "denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data." The report says China refused to inform the World Health Organization that the virus "was a contagion" during the month of January so it could import medical supplies from abroad, and says its conclusions are based on the 95% probability that the changes in China's imports and exports were outside of the normal range.

3. **Trump thinks around 80,000-100,000 Americans will die as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and he considers that a success of his administration.** "That’s one of the reasons we’re successful, if you call losing 80 or 90 thousand people successful," Trump told Fox News. "I used to say 65,000, and now I’m saying 80 or 90 and it goes up and it goes up rapidly, but it’s still going to be, no matter how you look at it, at the lower end of the plane if we did the shutdown." He added: "We’re going to lose anywhere from 75, 80 to 100,000 people. That’s a horrible thing." Epidemiologists, however, estimate that the current U.S. death toll from the virus, which currently stands at more than 68,400 people, is [actually much higher](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2020/05/02/excess-deaths-during-covid-19/?arc404=true) and may have already surpassed the 100,000 mark.

4. **Trump said he gets treated worse by the press than Abraham Lincoln.** Trump told Fox News that he is "greeted with a hostile press the likes of which no president has ever seen," while sitting in front of the Lincoln Memorial. "The closest would be that gentleman right up there," Trump said, gesturing toward the statue of Lincoln. "They always said nobody got treated worse than Lincoln," he added. "I believe I am treated worse." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/04/politics/trump-lincoln-press-treatment-deaths/index.html))
