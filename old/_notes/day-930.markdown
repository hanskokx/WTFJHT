1. **Rep. Joaquin Castro, twin brother of 2020 presidential candidate Juli√°n Castro, tweeted out a list of names and occupations of constituents in his Texas congressional district who have maxed out their contributions to the Trump campaign**. The tweet contained a graphic titled "Who's funding Trump?" and listed 44 people who have donated the maximum amount of money allowed by federal law. "Sad to see so many San Antonians as 2019 maximum donors to Donald Trump," Castro tweeted. "Their contributions are fueling a campaign of hate that labels Hispanic immigrants as 'invaders.'" All of the information in Castro's tweet, including the occupations of the donors, is public information.

2. **Trump's campaign put out a video that included two clearly visible signs promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory**. The signs appear in a close-up shot of a "Women for Trump" video published online by the Trump campaign in late July. It is unclear whether the ad was being broadcast on TV or just online. The inclusion of the signs could have been accidental, especially since Trump rallies have become prominent gathering spots for so many of the QAnon conspiracy theorists. A warm-up speaker at one of Trump's rallies last week, for example, recited a popular QAnon slogan during his speech. The Women for Trump video appears to have been removed from YouTube.

3. **The owner of the online message board 8chan was called to testify before Congress after the website was linked to the terrorist attack in El Paso, TX over the weekend**. The House Homeland Security Committee demanded that 8chan owner Jim Watkins testify about site's efforts to address "the proliferation of extremist content, including white supremacist content." Committee chair Bennie Thompson and the ranking Republican Mike Rogers sent a letter to Watkins, an American citizen living in the Philippines, noting that the El Paso massacre was "at least the third act of supremacist violence linked to your website this year."

4. **Kim Jong Un supervised a live-fire demonstration of newly developed short-range ballistic missiles in an attempt to send a warning to the United States and South Korea**. North Korea has conducted four rounds of weapons demonstrations in two weeks, all of which come during a stalemate in nuclear negotiations between Trump and Kim. Trump has repeatedly dismissed the significance of the tests, which experts say has given North Korea more room to develop its capabilities to strike South Korea and the U.S. ahead of negotiations. Meanwhile, the U.S. and its allies have been conducting military drills of their own, and negotiations are set to resume when those drills end later this month.
