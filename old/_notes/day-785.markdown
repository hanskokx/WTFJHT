1. **North Korea threatened to suspend denuclearization negotiations with the Trump administration and resume its nuclear and missile testing programs** because Trump's national security adviser and Secretary of State had created an "atmosphere of hostility and mistrust." Kim Jong-un's Vice Foreign Minister said Kim's personal relationship with Trump was "still good and the chemistry is mysteriously wonderful," but members of Trump's team had spoiled the two leaders' negotiations in Hanoi, Vietnam last month. As a result, North Korea said it might end its self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests. Choe Son-hui said the decision to end the moratorium is up to Kim, and that "he will make his decision in a short period of time."

2. **The Trump administration is considering sending a volunteer force to the southern border**, according to four current and former officials. Trump has been "casting about" for novel ways to direct additional resources to the border to stop people from crossing illegally. One DHS official said the move "makes eminent sense for a hurricane," but not for border security. "All of this is just to buttress the administration’s claim that there’s an emergency," they added.

3. **Trump said that "people on the right" are tougher than those on the left and warned that "it would be very bad, very bad" if his supporters on the right ever decided to stop restraining themselves.** Specifically, Trump noted that he has "the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump," but "they don’t play it tough." But if people on the left ever "go to a certain point," he continued, "then it would be very bad, very bad."

4. **Foreign countries are increasingly turning to lobbying firms to try and curry favor with Trump and influence U.S. policy.** Some of the countries employing lobbying firms are U.S. allies, while others include countries with deeply stained human rights records such as Zimbabwe, Kosovo, Georgia, Turkey and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Foreign countries have turned to lobbying firms in the past, but the number of countries with ties to the Trump campaign has gone up sharply. The lobbyists with Trump ties have also been charging exorbitant fees in exchange for representing companies that need help overseas, such as Chinese telecom giant ZTE.
