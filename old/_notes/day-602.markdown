2. **The Trump administration quietly redirected $200 million from various DHS programs to ICE accounts despite repeated congressional warnings about ICE's "lack of fiscal discipline" and "unsustainable" spending habits.** The news comes a day after a financial document was released showing that $10 million was diverted from FEMA to ICE in June to help pay for ICE detention operations. Of the $200 million, $93 million will go toward immigrant detention and $107 million will go toward paying for deportations.

3. **Meanwhile, the overall number of migrant children who have been separated from their families and detained at the border has risen to the highest number ever recorded.** Population levels at federal shelters for migrant children have increased more than fivefold since last summer. This month, there were more than 12,800 children in custody, compared to 2,400 in May 2017. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/us/migrant-children-detention.html))

4. **Sen. Corey Booker released another batch of confidential documents related to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.** The 28 new documents are from Kavanaugh's time in the George W. Bush White House and show his involvement in judicial nominations, including the more controversial judges from that time. Kavanaugh told a Senate committee in 2006 that he wasn't involved in the controversial nomination of circuit court nominee Charles Pickering, but the documents released Wednesday show the opposite. Kavanaugh held meetings with Republican senators and was closely involved in Pickering's nomination.

5. **Trump has made 5,000 false or misleading claims during his time in office.** His 5,000th claim came yesterday in the form of a tweet about Robert Mueller: "Russian ‘collusion’ was just an excuse by the Democrats for having lost the Election!" Trump passed the 2,000 mark on Jan. 10 of this year.
