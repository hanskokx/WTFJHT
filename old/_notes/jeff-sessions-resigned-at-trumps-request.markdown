**Trump forced Jeff Sessions to resign**. Matthew Whitaker – Sessions's chief of staff – will take over as acting attorney general. "Dear Mr. President, at your request I am submitting my resignation," Sessions wrote in his letter. Whitaker will assume oversight of Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and possible collusion by Trump's campaign in that meddling. Trump has repeatedly attacked Sessions for recusing himself from oversight of the probe in 2017 after it was revealed that he had met more than once with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the 2016 campaign despite saying he had not met with any Russians during his confirmation hearing. Rod Rosenstein, who oversees Mueller's investigation, would normally be in line to become the acting attorney general, but their relationship has been strained with Trump publicly complaining about Rosenstein. Mueller, meanwhile, is looking into Trump's previous statements about wanting to fire Sessions or force his resignation to determine whether those acts are part of a pattern of attempted obstruction of justice. Trump tweeted: "We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well! A permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date." Whitaker by law can serve as acting AG for a maximum of 210 days.
