1. **Senators reached an agreement with Trump administration officials early this morning on a $2 trillion stimulus package to combat the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic.** The package will provide direct payments of $1,200 to all workers with incomes up to $75,000 per year, before phasing out and ending altogether for those earning $99,000 per year or more. Families would also receive an additional $500 per child. The new $500 billion fund to bail out distressed businesses will also have stronger oversight after complaints from Democrats. "Ladies and gentleman, we are done," said Eric Ueland, the White House legislative affairs director. "We have a deal." The relief package is the largest in American history. A final vote is expected this afternoon.

2. **Trump's businesses and Trump-owned companies are prohibited under the new stimulus package from receiving loans or investments from Treasury programs.** Firms owned by the president, vice president, members of Congress, or heads of executive departments would all be excluded from receiving that aid under the current language of the bill, including companies controlled by their children, spouses or in-laws.

3. **Scientists are currently testing more than 100 different drugs in the hunt to find a cure or vaccine for the coronavirus.** A vaccine is likely still many months away, and researchers have yet to find any treatment that has proven to be safe and effective.
