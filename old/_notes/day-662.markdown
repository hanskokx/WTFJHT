1. **Trump doesn't want to give any more federal relief funding to Puerto Rico** because he thinks the island's government is using the relief money to pay off its debt (it's not). Trump won't be able to take back any of the money that Congress has already set aside for Puerto Rico, but he could refuse to sign a future spending bill unless money for Puerto Rico is excluded from the bill.

2. **Democrats in the House are preparing to probe almost every aspect of Trump's life and work.** Democrats plan to target at least 85 different topics for potential subpoena and investigation, including Trump's taxes, his family business, and his targeting of the press.

3. **Stacey Abrams filed a new lawsuit in federal court asking a judge to delay Georgia's vote certifications by one day** to give officials time to count any votes that were wrongly rejected. If the suit is successful, officials would have until Wednesday to restore at least 1,095 votes that weren't counted. Neither campaign can agree on how many votes remain to be counted.

4. **The election overseer for Palm Beach County in Florida says there is no way the machine recount will be finished by Thursday's deadline.** "It's impossible," said the supervisor of elections. Both parties seem to agree that completing the recount in time to meet the deadline is not going to happen. Palm Beach County GOP Chairman Michael Barnett said the inability to meet the deadline was "good news for Republicans because our candidates are ahead."

5. **Trump claimed the ballots in Florida were "massively infected" and made more allegations of voter fraud without providing any evidence to support his claims.** He demanded that the election be called in favor of Republicans and said the recount efforts should stop immediately.
