1. **Don McGahn is out as White House counsel.** McGahn had already been planning to leave the White House, but his exit was expedited after Trump announced Patrick Cipollone as McGahn's successor. Cippolone served as a Justice Department lawyer under the George H.W. Bush administration.

2. **A federal judge rejected Paul Manafort's request to appear in court wearing a profession suit and instead ordered Manafort to appear in court wearing a prison jumpsuit.** "This defendant should be treated no differently from other defendants who are in custody post conviction," said Judge T.S. Ellis III in a sharply worded judicial order. Manafort's attorney requested that his client be allowed to wear street clothing at his hearing on Friday and during all future court appearances, but the judge said Manafort will have to wear the standard dark-green prison jumpsuit.

3. **Aras Agalarov formed a U.S. shell company a month before his June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Don Jr. and other high-level Trump campaign officials.** Agalarov formed the company anonymously while preparing to move almost $20 million into the U.S., while using an accountant whose clients have been accused of money laundering and embezzlement involving millions of dollars. Agalarov is a close business associate of Trump and a Moscow-based property developer who has won major contracts from Vladimir Putin.

4. **American intelligence agencies are growing increasingly confident that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.** The intelligence agencies have not yet been able to definitively say whether MBS directly ordered the killing, or whether he meant to have Khashoggi abducted and taken back to Saudi Arabia. But they have growing circumstantial evidence that points to the prince's involvement. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/world/middleeast/pompeo-khashoggi-murder.html))

5. **Audio leaked to a pro-Turkish government newspaper reveals that Khashoggi was dead within minutes of his capture.** His fingers were severed, he was beheaded, his body was dismembered, and his killers were gone all within two hours. The Turkish government released those and other leaks about the recordings just as U.S. Sec. of State Mike Pompeo was visiting Ankara. The leaks were meant to increase pressure on the U.S. and Saudi governments and get them to provide answers about Khashoggi's disappearance and death.
