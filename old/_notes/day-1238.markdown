1. **The White House coronavirus task force hasn't held one of its daily briefings in more than a month, even as the virus continues to kill up to 1,000 Americans per day.** Trump and top White House officials are insisting that they "made every decision correctly," and that the outbreak is well in hand. "We may have some embers or some ashes or we may have some flames coming," Trump said last week, "but we’ll put them out. We’ll stomp them out." Meanwhile, 19 states are currently seeing the number of new cases rise each day as the total number of U.S. cases nears the 2 million mark, and data from the states reporting some of their highest seven-day averages of new cases show the spikes can not be explained by a continued increase in testing.

2. **Trump's golf courses in Scotland are expected to receive a tax rebate of nearly £1 million as part of a government bailout package for tourism businesses impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.** Trump's resorts in Aberdeenshire and Turnberry will both receive emergency funding from the Scottish government. Property taxes paid by hospitality, leisure and retail businesses in Scotland will be waived. Trump Turnberry owed £850,766 in property taxes for this year, while Trump Aberdeenshire owed £121,170. Both properties are expected to qualify for 100% relief. Both properties have also been able to avoid paying the main business tax in the UK, known as the corporation tax, because they consistently report such heavy losses due to their debts to Trump himself, which totaled £155 million in 2018.

3. **27% of Americans say they somewhat or strongly agree that Trump is a religious person, while 55% somewhat or strongly disagree.** 50% of all Christians in the U.S. don't view Trump as religious, while 40% evangelicals say he is. Ideological conservatives (55%) and Republicans (60%) were the only two groups in which a majority of respondents characterized Trump as religious.
