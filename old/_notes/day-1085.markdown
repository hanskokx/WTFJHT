1. **Trump met privately with Mitch McConnell at the White House to discuss the upcoming Senate impeachment trial**. McConnell walked Trump through the trial format and the Republican reactions to recent developments. McConnell's office has been in discussion with the White House for weeks regarding the trial, working together on various ideas and proposals for how the trial should be set up. "We want this to start as quickly as possible," said the White House legislative director. "We want the President to be acquitted as quickly as possible."

2. **Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin wants to wait until after the election to disclose how much taxpayers have been paying to protect Trump and his family while they travel**. Democrats have been pushing a bill that would require the Treasury to disclose the costs related to the travel of Trump and his adult children within 120 days after it passes. Mnuchin has agreed to release the figures, but wants the disclosures to start after the 2020 election.

3. **Chinese President Xi Jinping's chief trade negotiator will travel to the U.S. next week to sign a phase-one trade deal with the U.S.** China's Commerce Ministry confirmed the visit, marking the first official acknowledgment by the Chinese government that they plan to sign the agreement to help ease bilateral tensions between the world's two largest economies.

4. **The Trump administration is working to change environmental rules to make it easier to build pipelines, mines, and other industrial projects**. The move would narrow the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act and exempt projects without significant federal funding from environmental reviews that have been a requirement for the last 50 years. The proposed regulations would also redefine "major federal action" to exclude privately financed projects with minimal government funding or involvement.
