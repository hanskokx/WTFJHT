1. **The Trump administration will propose a new rule that would allow families to be held together in detention beyond the 20-day limit required under the rule known as the Flores agreement**. Trump and the GOP have repeatedly blamed the 20-day rule for encouraging migrants to arrive at the border with their children, expecting to be released. Administration officials expect the new rule to serve as a deterrent against Mexican and Central American migrant families. The Trump administration proposed a similar rule in September 2018 that would have allowed the government to detain migrant children for longer periods of time, as long as they are treated with "dignity, respect and special concern for their particular vulnerability as minors," as per the Flores agreement. The latest version of the rule would replace the standards outlined in the Flores agreement with specific requirements for detention centers that would be set by ICE officials.
