1. **Hundreds of migrant children have been moved under the cover of night from shelters in various states into a barren tent city in West Texas over the last few weeks.** Until now, most undocumented children in U.S. federal custody have been housed in private shelters or foster homes, where they received formal schooling and regular visits with legal representatives assigned to their cases. Now, they live in rows of sand-colored tents in Tornillo, Texas with no schooling and limited access to legal resources. The mass reshuffling of migrant children shows no sign of slowing.

2. **The White House is limiting the scope of the FBI's investigation into the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh.** Only the allegations made by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez will be investigated, and the White House has provided a list of witnesses the FBI will be permitted to interview. Trump claimed that he did not place any limits on the FBI, but the FBI said it has not received any new instructions that would change the limits imposed by the White House counsel's office â€” including a specific list of witnesses that does not include Kavanaugh's third accuser, Julie Swetnick.

3. **Sens. Jeff Flake and Chris Coons said that if the FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh finds that he lied to the Senate Judiciary Committee then his nomination would likely not move forward.** During an interview, Flake and Coons were asked, "If Kavanaugh is shown to have lied to the committee, nomination's over?" Flake responded, "Oh yes." Coons added: "I would think so." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/30/politics/flake-fbi-kavanaugh-investigation/index.html))

4. **The prosecutor Republicans hired to question Dr. Ford during last week's hearing said no "reasonable prosecutor" would bring charges against Kavanaugh based on the public evidence so far.** Rachel Mitchell sent a memo to all Republican senators that said her "bottom line" was that "a 'he said, she said' case is incredibly difficult to prove," but that "this case is even weaker than that." Mitchell said Ford's witnesses all either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them, and said Ford had inconsistencies in her testimony and memory. She concluded: "I do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee."

5. **The U.S. and Canada reached a last-minute deal to save the North American Free Trade Agreement on Sunday.** Trump hailed the agreement as "a great deal for all three countries" and said that it "solves the many deficiencies and mistakes in NAFTA, greatly opens markets to our Farmers and Manufacturers, reduces Trade Barriers to the U.S. and will bring all three Great Nations together in competition with the rest of the world." In a joint statement, Canada's foreign affairs minister said the deal "will give our workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses a high-standard trade agreement that will result in freer markets, fairer trade and robust economic growth in our region."

6. **The Justice Department is suing California to block its new law that restores net neutrality protections that the FCC got rid of last year.** The Justice Department is arguing that the FCC has sole jurisdiction to regulate net neutrality. Jeff Sessions said in a statement that "states do not regulate interstate commerce - the federal government does."
