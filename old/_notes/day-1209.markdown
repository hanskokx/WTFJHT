1. **Dr. Anthony Fauci will testify remotely before the Senate Health Education, Labor and Pensions Committee this morning that Americans will experience "needless suffering and death" if the country reopens too quickly.** "The major message that I wish to convey to the Senate HLP committee tomorrow is the danger of trying to open the country prematurely," Fauci told the New York Times in an email. "If we skip over the checkpoints in the guidelines to: ‘Open America Again,’ then we risk the danger of multiple outbreaks throughout the country. This will not only result in needless suffering and death, but would actually set us back on our quest to return to normal." Today's testimony will be Fauci's first Congressional appearance since Trump declared a national emergency in March.

2. **An unreleased coronavirus task force report shows that coronavirus infection rates are spiking to new highs in several cities and smaller communities across the country**, contradicting Trump's recent claims that "all throughout the country, the numbers are coming down rapidly." The undisclosed data in the May 7 report shows the 10 areas with the highest rates of infection — which includes Nashville, TN, Des Moines, IA, Amarillo, TX and Central City, KY — recorded surges of 72.4% or greater over a seven-day period when compared to the previous week. Central City saw an increase of 650%. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/unreleased-white-house-report-shows-coronavirus-rates-spiking-heartland-communities-n1204751))

3. **Mike Pence will be "maintaining distance for the immediate future" from Trump after consulting with the White House medical unit**. It is not clear exactly how long Pence plans to stay away from Trump. Trump said he hasn't seen Pence since Pence's press secretary Katie Miller tested positive for the virus on Friday, but the two have been in contact via telephone. Pence said he has been taking extra precautions lately, including by spending time "in a separate room on my own" instead of joining other members of the coronavirus task force in the situation room.
