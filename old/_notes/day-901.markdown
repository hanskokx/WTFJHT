1. **Trump attacked Theresa May on Twitter and said the U.S. would no longer deal with the British ambassador to the U.S. after cables were leaked revealing that the diplomat called Trump "inept" and said his administration was "dysfunctional."** Trump attacked Sir Kim Darroch for the second day in a row, threatening to cut ties altogether over the leaked memos, which described Trump as "radiating insecurity." "I do not know the Ambassador," Trump tweeted, "but he is not liked or well thought of within the U.S. We will no longer deal with him." On Sunday, Trump told reporters, "We are not big fans of that man and he has not served the UK well … so I can understand it and I can say things about him, but I won’t bother."

2. **The White House blocked a key witness in the Mueller investigation from answering more than 200 questions about potential obstruction of justice by Trump**. Annie Donaldson is the former chief of staff to ex-White House counsel Donald McGahn, and her meticulous contemporaneous notes are cited 65 times in the Mueller report. But Trump administration lawyers barred her from going into more detail about her notes or her thinking during the time when she documented several exchanges between Trump and McGahn. In total, the White House blocked Donaldson from answering 212 questions, according to her written answers, which were released on Monday.

3. **House Democrats plan to move forward with criminal contempt proceedings against Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for defying congressional subpoenas for documents related to the addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 Census**. The move is largely a symbolic one, which may serve as an embarrassment for the Trump administration officials but is unlikely to lead to many tangible consequences. The DOJ will most likely refuse to charge the AG or any other cabinet secretary with a crime and has even urged officials not to comply with the House Oversight and Reform Committee's subpoenas.

4. **Secretary of State Mike Pompeo unveiled a panel aimed at providing him with "an informed review of the role of human rights in American foreign policy."** During remarks to the State Department, Pompeo said "words like ‘rights’ can be used by good or evil," and complained that some have "hijacked" the rhetoric of human rights and used it for "dubious or malignant purposes." While Pompeo offered little detail as to what the panel will actually do, emphasizing its focus on outlining principles instead of directing policy, he said he hoped the panel would facilitate "one of the most profound reexaminations of the unalienable rights in the world since the 1948 universal declaration."
