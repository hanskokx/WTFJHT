1. **Trump says he's not concerned about North Korea's recent ballistic missile tests.** At a press conference with Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, Trump directly contradicted his national security adviser and his Japanese host by arguing that Kim Jong Un had not launched any ballistic missiles this month or violated any U.N. Security Council resolutions against testing. "My people think it could have been a violation," Trump said. "I view it differently."

1. **Iran said it sees no prospect of negotiations with the United States** just a day after Trump claimed a deal with Iran over its nuclear program was possible. "I really believe that Iran would like to make a deal," Trump said. "And I think that’s very smart of them, and I think that’s a possibility to happen." A spokesperson for the Iranian Foreign Ministry responded: "We currently see no prospect of negotiations with America." He continued: "Iran pays no attention to words. What matters to us is a change of approach and behavior." ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-nuclear-idUSKCN1SY0JJ))
