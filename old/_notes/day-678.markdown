1. **Paul Manafort's attorney repeatedly briefed Trump's legal team about Manafort's discussions with federal prosecutors after he signed the cooperation agreement with the special counsel.** The briefings made tensions worse between Manafort and the special counsel after prosecutors learned about them. While Manafort's attorney's discussions with Trump's lawyers didn't violate any laws, they did help to degrade Manafort's relationship with the Mueller and his team.

2. **Right wing conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi emailed Roger Stone to let him know about a forthcoming Wikileaks email dump two months before the emails were released.** "Word is friend in embassy plans 2 more dumps," Corsi wrote on Aug. 2, 2016. "One shortly after I'm back. 2nd in Oct. Impact planned to be very damaging." The email was included in draft court documents known as statements of the offense, which were sent to Corsi by Mueller's team. Mueller also sent Corsi a draft plea agreement and said he would not oppose a probation sentence for Corsi if he agreed to plead guilty to one count of lying to federal investigators.

3. **The Trump administration waived FBI fingerprint checks for caregivers and mental health workers in charge of thousands of teens at a migrant detention camp.** None of the 2,100 staffers working at a tent city holding camp with more than 2,300 migrant teenagers have gone through the rigorous FBI fingerprint background check process. "Instead," reads an HHS memo, the camp is "using checks conducted by a private contractor that has access to less comprehensive data, thereby heightening the risk that an individual with a criminal history could have direct access to children." The federal government is also allowing the facility to forgo mental health care requirements that mandate at least one mental health clinician for every 12 children. Instead, the camp has one for every 100 kids. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/0c62b088c27147b0a6055d1e8394a3af))

4. **Trump blamed the Federal Reserve for the GM plant closures and layoffs, as well as the recent declines in the stock market.** Trump said he is "not even a little bit happy" with Jerome "Jay" Powell, who Trump hand picked to head the country's central bank. "So far," Trump said, "I’m not even a little bit happy with my selection of Jay. Not even a little bit. And I’m not blaming anybody, but I’m just telling you I think that the Fed is way off-base with what they’re doing." He continued: "I’m doing deals, and I’m not being accommodated by the Fed. They’re making a mistake because I have a gut, and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else’s brain can ever tell me."

5. **Trump threatened to cancel his upcoming summit with Vladimir Putin over Russia's recent [maritime skirmish](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russia-shrugs-off-western-pressure-over-black-sea-incident-with-ukraine/2018/11/27/308a2df0-f245-11e8-99c2-cfca6fcf610c_story.html?utm_term=.036b21ea8425) with Ukraine.** Trump said he is waiting for a full report on the incident, during which Putin captured three Ukrainian ships and their crews in the Black Sea on Sunday, before making a final decision on whether he will cancel the planned summit in Argentina this week. The report "will be very determinative," Trump said. "Maybe I won’t have the meeting. Maybe I won’t even have the meeting." Russia said that it still expects the meeting to go ahead as planned.

6. **Trump again dismissed his own government's report on the devastating impacts of climate change and global warming**, saying he doesn't see climate change as a man-made issue and that he doesn't believe the scientific consensus. "One of the problems that a lot of people like myself," Trump said, "we have very high levels of intelligence but we’re not necessarily such believers." He continued: "You look at our air and our water, and it’s right now at a record clean."

7. **Contributions to the NRA went down by $55 million in 2017**, according to the gun-rights group's latest tax records. The NRA reported $98 million in contributions in 2017, down from almost $125 million in 2016. In addition to the drop in contributions, membership dues were also down by roughly $35 million.
