1. **National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien says he was the one who removed Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and his brother Yevgeny from the National Security Council, not Trump.** "Those were my decisions and I stand by them," he said. O'Brien also claimed that Vindman and his brother weren't fired, they were simply rotated out of the White House ahead of schedule. "It was just time for them to go back," O'Brien added, "their service was no longer needed." Trump, however, admitted the day after Vindman's ouster that Vindman was removed because he was "insubordinate" and "reported the contents of my 'perfect' phone calls incorrectly."

2. **The fourth federal prosecutor resigned from the Roger Stone case after the Justice Department announced that it planned to reduce the sentencing recommendation for Stone**.

3. **Trump withdrew his nomination for the Treasury Department's undersecretary for terrorism and financial crimes**. Trump had originally planned to nominate former U.S. attorney for D.C. Jessie Liu, who was confirmed in September 2017 to lead the U.S. attorney's largest office and oversee high-profile prosecutions like those against Roger Stone, Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, and others stemming from the Mueller probe. Liu resigned from the U.S. attorney's office last month after Trump announced his plans to nominate her to the Treasury undersecretary position.
