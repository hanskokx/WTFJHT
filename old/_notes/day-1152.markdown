1. **The Trump administration offered "large sums of money" to a German company so it would bring its coronavirus research to the U.S. and make its potential vaccine exclusively available to U.S. patients.** Trump made the offer during a meeting with the CEO of CureVac at the White House on March 2. The German newspaper Welt am Sontag reported that an unidentified German government source said Trump would do anything to get a vaccine for the United States, "but only for the United States." Germany's Health Ministry confirmed that Trump had made the offer, and that Berlin has been offering CureVac financial incentives to remain in Germany. Two U.S. officials said the Trump administration has spoken to at least 25 companies that say they can help with a vaccine, and is open to speaking to others. Richard Grenell, U.S. ambassador to Germany and acting DNI, tweeted that the report about Trump's offer to CureVac was "wrong."

2. **The Federal Reserve cut interest rates to 0% and offered to buy at least $700 billion in government and mortgage-related bonds in order to protect the U.S. economy from incurring any more damage as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.** The Fed is also giving more-generous loans to banks around the country so they can turn around and offer loans to small businesses and families in need of a lifeline. The moves represent the most dramatic steps taken by the U.S. central bank since the 2008 financial crisis. Despite the Fed's efforts, stock futures dropped sharply when markets opened Monday morning, hitting "limit down" levels of 5% or lower. No prices can now trade below that 5% threshold. DJIA futures were down more than 1,000 points, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures also hit their downside limits.

3. **The White House announced that more coronavirus drive-through and walk-through testing locations are set to open this week.** The sites will be equipped to test 2-4,000 people per day. Priority status will be given to healthcare workers, first responders, people over the age of 65, as well as those with respiratory symptoms and fevers above 99.9 degrees. Adm. Brett Giroir, who is coordinating testing efforts for the Department of Health and Human Services, said the U.S. is currently "going from somewhat manual, relatively slow phases, to a testing regimen that we can test many tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of individuals per week, and maybe even more." Officials said roughly 2 million tests are expected to be available this week and more than 10 states currently have drive-through testing sites.

4. **Most of the 2.1 million federal workers in the U.S. will report to work in person today**, despite widespread closures and remote work setups across the country. The Trump administration urged agencies in the D.C. area to "offer maximum telework flexibilities" to employees who are eligible for remote work, but the directive was not mandatory and it left out most government employees — only 15% of federal workers are located in the D.C. area.

5. **The first clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine will begin today.** The first participant in the clinical trial will receive an experimental dose of the vaccine. The trial is being funded by the National Institutes of Health and is taking place at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. The vaccine will be tested on 45 young, healthy volunteers, who will receive different doses of shots that were co-developed by the NIH and Moderna Inc. Officials say it will take anywhere from a year to 18 months to fully validate any potential vaccine. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/8089a3d0ec8f9fde971bddd7b3aa2ba1))

6. **Trump says he is "strongly considering" a full pardon for former national security adviser Michael Flynn.** Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about the nature of his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak prior to Trump’s inauguration. "After destroying his life & the life of his wonderful family (and many others also), the FBI, working in conjunction with the Justice Department, has ‘lost’ the records of General Michael Flynn," Trump tweeted shortly after the Justice Department initiated a review of the criminal case against Flynn. "How convenient," he added. "I am strongly considering a Full Pardon!" Flynn is currently attempting to withdraw his guilty plea, claiming that he was the victim of prosecutorial misconduct during his initial trial.

7. poll/ **60% of Americans believe the worst is yet to come for the U.S. coronavirus pandemic.** 40% say their daily lives will change as a result of the pandemic. 45% approve of Trump's handling of the pandemic — which is almost identical to his overall job performance rating in that same poll.
