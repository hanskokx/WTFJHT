1. **The Justice Department admitted that it is withholding 24 emails related to Trump's involvement in withholding millions of dollars in security aid to Ukraine**. The emails were sent between June and September 2019. The court filing by the DOJ marks the first official acknowledgement that the emails containing Trump's thinking regarding the hold on the aid exist, and that Trump was directly involved in asking for the hold as early as June. The Trump administration is still blocking the emails from the public and from Congress.

2. **Lindsay Graham warned that the GOP could launch investigations into Joe Biden and the whistleblower in Trump's impeachment trial**. "I want to know how all this crap started," Graham told Fox News. Graham said he also wants to know if the whistleblower is a former employee or associate of Joe Biden, and if the whistleblower "was working with people on \[House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam\] Schiffâ€™s staff that wanted to take Trump down a year and a half ago" so he can "get to the bottom of all of this to make sure this never happens again." Iowa Senator Joni Ernst also warned that Republicans could immediately push to impeach Joe Biden over his work in Ukraine as vice president if he wins the White House in 2020.

3. **The Trump administration has been hiring lawyers as immigration judges who have no experience in immigration law**. The experience requirement section in the judge vacancy announcements doesn't even mention immigration law experience, only that applicants must have seven years of "post-bar experience as a licensed attorney preparing for, participating in, and/or appealing formal hearings or trials." Of the 28 new immigration judges recently sworn in by the Executive Office for Immigration Review, only 17 of them had any immigration law experience.

4. **Trump congratulated the Kansas City Chiefs and the "Great State of Kansas" on Twitter after the Chiefs won the Super Bowl, even though the Chiefs are based in Missouri**. Trump quickly deleted the tweet and posted a new one with the correct state.
