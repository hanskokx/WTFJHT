1. **The world's largest automakers warned Trump that his plan to weaken tailpipe pollution standards is a threat to their profits and will produce "untenable" instability in the manufacturing sector.** In a letter signed by 17 companies including Ford, General Motors, Toyota, and Volvo, the companies urged Trump not to roll back the policy. Trump's new rule would all but eliminate the Obama-era auto pollution regulations and effectively freeze miles-per-gallon standards at 37 mpg for  cars, instead of the original goal of reaching 54.5 mpg by 2025. The automakers warned Trump that "an extended period of litigation and instability" would follow if his plans are implemented.

2. **The Justice and Commerce departments rejected demands from House Democrats to provide more documents about the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 Census.** Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd sent a letter to House Oversight Committee chair Elijah Cummings and said the documents in question are protected by attorney-client privilege and therefore cannot be disclosed. Boyd wrote that the committee's "insistence that the department immediately turn over these documents ... is improper," and added that the Justice Department has already handed over tens of thousands of documents.

3. **Elijah Cummings indicated that he plans to move forward with contempt votes for Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in response to the Justice and Commerce departments refusal to turn over documents.** "We gave Attorney General Barr and Secretary Ross every opportunity to produce the documents the Committee needs for our investigation," Cummings said in a statement, "but rather than cooperate, they have decided that they would rather be held in contempt of Congress." The panel is scheduled to vote next week to hold Barr and Ross in contempt of Congress, the same week the House will vote to hold Barr in contempt for failing to provide the full, unredacted Mueller report and underlying evidence to Congress.
