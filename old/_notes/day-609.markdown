1. **Sen. Clair McCaskill says she will vote against Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court, though not because of the allegations against him.** McCaskill says she will vote "no" because of "his positions on several key issues, most importantly the avalanche of dark, anonymous money that is crushing our democracy." McCaskill says Kavanaugh "revealed his bias against limits on campaign donations" and that she is "uncomfortable about his view on Presidential power," as well as his "position that corporations are people."

2. **Former government officials have come forward to contradict Trump's claim that the FBI cannot investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.** Other Republican leaders in the Senate have echoed Trump's claims, but several officials who have had direct roles in the nomination and background check processes say it's actually common.

3. **A former classmate of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford is walking back her claims that she knew about the alleged assault at the time it happened.** "That it happened or not, I have no idea," said Cristina Miranda King. "I can't say that it did or didn't." King recently stated definitively in a now-deleted post on FB that "The incident DID happen, many of us heard about it in school."

4. **Florida gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis (R) is dealing with his campaign's fifth race-related controversy after newly unearthed tweets showed one of his campaign allies using a racial slur to describe Barack Obama.** "FUCK THE MUSLIM N-----," wrote Steven Alembik, who has donated more than $20,000 to DeSantis' campaign. A DeSantis' campaign spokesperson said that they "adamantly denounce this sort of disgusting rhetoric."

6. **Trump has named retiring Rep. Darrell Issa to head the U.S. Trade and Development Agency.** Issa is the former House Oversight Committee chairman, and has been in Congress for nine terms. He built a name for himself by clashing with the Obama administration for years and by accusing top officials at the IRS of targeting conservative groups for political purposes.
