1. **The Trump administration is expected to unveil sweeping changes to federal clean water rules that would weaken protections for millions of acres of wetlands and thousands of miles of streams against pesticide runoff and other pollutants.** The proposed reforms would chip away at standards that were put in place during the George H.W. Bush administration. Trump is expected to pitch his plan as a response to a federal land grab that infringes on the rights of farmers and rural property owners. The current rules prohibit farmers from using land near streams and wetlands for certain kinds of plowing and planting, and requires special permits from the EPA in order to use certain chemical pesticides or fertilizers that could end up in those waters. Trump's new plan would lift those restrictions. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/climate/trump-clean-water-rollback.html))

2. **The Supreme Court keeps refusing to hear cases that deal with volatile social issues, but the Trump administration keeps trying to rush those kinds of cases through the appeals system to get them in front of the high court as quickly as possible.** Since Brett Kavanaugh joined the bench in October, the court has refused to take cases from conservative-leaning states that want to deny public funds for women's healthcare, while it continues to postpone action on cases that deal with federal employment protections for gay and transgender people. Meanwhile, the Trump administration continues to try and push certain cases on immigration, transgender rights, and the U.S. census past the liberal-leaning lower courts and in front of the Supreme Court.

3. **The targets of U.S. sanctions are trying to hire lobbyists with connections to Trump in order to help them reduce or get out of those sanctions entirely.** Some of the biggest payments to Washington's influence industry have gone to lobbyists, lawyers, and consultants with connections to Trump or his administration, a notion that reeks of the pay-to-play corruption often seen in the politics of many African, Asian, Middle Eastern, and former Soviet nations. "People overseas often want to hear that you know so-and-so, and can make a call to solve their problem," said a leading Washington sanctions lawyer. The trend has been encouraged by Trump administration officials who project Trump's willingness to make deals around sanctions and tariff exemptions.

4. **The Trump administration concealed for months a report that showed Wells Fargo overcharged college students for fees that were often several times larger than the average fees of its competitors.** The report was produced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under its former top student loan official, Seth Frotman, [who resigned in protest](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/27/seth-frotman-cfpb-resignation-student-loans-758036) back in August. The report examined the fees associated with debit cards and other financial offerings from 14 companies through agreements with more than 500 colleges in the United States. Wells Fargo handled about a quarter of those accounts, but collected more than half the fees paid by students and charged the highest fees at $50 a year for each account. Department of Education rules require colleges to make sure the products they offer are "not inconsistent with the best financial interests" of their students.
