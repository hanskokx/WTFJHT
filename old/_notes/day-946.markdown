1. **A federal appeals court ruled that members of the Electoral College can vote for whomever they want, regardless of their state's popular vote count**. The ruling states that Colorado illegally canceled the vote of a so-called faithless elector who wrote in John Kasich's name on his ballot in 2016, even though Hillary Clinton won the state of Colorado and its nine electoral votes. The court majority wrote that states "do not have the constitutional authority to interfere with presidential electors who exercise their constitutional right to vote for the president and vice president candidates of their choice." The case marks the first time a federal appeals court has ruled on whether electors could be bound in how they vote.
