1. **A new report from the Department of Homeland Security's independent watchdog found that squalid conditions at migrants detention camps are more widespread than initially revealed**. The report describes standing-room-only cells, children without access to showers or hot meals, and detainees desperately begging to be released. Inspectors visited five facilities in June, where they found many migrants are given only wet wipes to clean themselves and bologna sandwiches to eat, leading to additional health problems. Children at two of the camps were not given hot meals until inspectors arrived. Overcrowding was so severe that migrants were banging on cell walls and pressing notes up against the windows begging for help.

2. **The National Parks Service is diverting $2.5 million in entrance and recreation fees meant to improve U.S. parks in order to cover costs associated with Trump's Fourth of July celebration on the National Mall**. Trump officials has consistently refused to disclose how much taxpayers will have to pay for the ceremony, which Trump has dubbed the "Salute to America." The diverted park fees make up just a fraction of the extra costs the government will have to pay as a result of the event, which will include tanks, military flyovers, Air Force One, and an extended pyrotechnics display.

* **MSNBC is not planning to air Trump's "Salute to America" celebration**, though the network will assess in real time whether to air clips of the event.

1. **Trump plans to hold a campaign rally in North Carolina on the same day Robert Mueller is scheduled to testify publicly to Congress**. Trump's campaign announced that he will be returning to Greenville, N.C. on July 17 to offer counterprogramming to Mueller's highly anticipated public testimony about his report on Russian election interference in 2016 and possible obstruction of justice by Trump. The Trump campaign's chief operating officer said the rally will be an opportunity to highlight "the successes of the Trump presidency."
