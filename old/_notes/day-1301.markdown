1. **A federal judge in New York invalidated rule changes made by the Trump administration that would have allowed individuals and corporations to kill large numbers of birds as long as they could prove the birds weren't specifically targeted.** U.S. District Judge Valerie E. Caproni said there is nothing in the century-old Migratory Bird Treaty Act that indicates that in order for an action to be prohibited, it must be directed specifically at birds. He added: "Nor does the statute prohibit only intentionally killing migratory birds. And it certainly does not say that only ‘some’ kills are prohibited." Under the Trump administration's reasoning, a company like BP, which was responsible for the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that killed up to a million birds, would not be liable for punishment under the changes to the law. "It is not only a sin to kill a mockingbird, it is also a crime," Judge Caproni wrote.

3. **Trump called Kamala Harris "nasty" during a press conference and said she was "the meanest, most disrespectful of anyone in the U.S. Senate."** He also described Harris as "the most liberal person in the United States Senate."
