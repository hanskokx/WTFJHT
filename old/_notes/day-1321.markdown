1. **Trump defended the Kenosha gunman and claimed that the 17-year-old acted in self-defense.** Trump said Kyle Rittenhouse, who is charged with killing two people in Wisconsin, was trying to get away and would have been killed by protesters if he hadn't shot them. "He was trying to get away from them," Trump said. "And then he fell and then they very violently attacked him. I guess he was in very big trouble." Trump added: "He probably would have been killed." Rittenhouse has been charged as an adult with two counts of first-degree homicide and one count of attempted homicide. His attorney says he plans to argue that he acted in self-defense.

2. **Trump compared police who shoot unarmed people to golfers who "choke" while putting.** "They choke. Just like in a golf tournament, they miss a three-foot putt," Trump said during an interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham. "You're not comparing it to golf," Ingraham interjected. Trump responded: "I'm saying people choke. People choke. And people are bad people. You have both. You have some bad people, and they choke. You could be a police officer for 15 years and all of a sudden you're confronted. You've got a quarter of a second to make a decision. If you don't make the decision, and you're wrong, you're dead. People choke under those circumstances, and they make a bad decision."

3. **Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf said Attorney General William Barr is "working on" conspiracy charges against leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement.** During an interview with Tucker Carlson on Fox News, Wolf said charging antifascists and leaders of the BLM movement with conspiracy under the RICO statute is "something that I have talked to \[Attorney General William Barr\] personally about." He added: "I know that they are working on it." RICO refers to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a federal law that focuses on acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization and was most famously used to take down organized crime in the U.S. Wolf said Barr was "targeting and investigating the heads of those organizations" as well as those who are "paying for those individuals to move across the country."

4. **Attorney General William Barr removed the head of a section of the Justice Department tasked with ensuring the legality of federal counter-terrorism and counter-intelligence activities.** Barr has yet to explain the removal of deputy assistant attorney general Brad Wiegmann, who was in charge of the office of law and policy in the national security section of the justice department until he was reassigned two weeks ago. Wiegmann will be replaced by 36-year old cyber-crimes prosecutor and political appointee, Kellen Dwyer, who has very little relevant experience. Dwyer made headlines in November 2018 when he accidentally revealed that federal charges had been secretly filed against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
