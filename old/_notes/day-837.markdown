1. **Trump: "Bob Mueller should not testify."** Trump no longer thinks the decision to have Mueller testify should be left up to Attorney General William Barr. Trump has previously said that Barr should make the decision — "I don’t know. That’s up to our attorney general, who I think has done a fantastic job." — and Barr said last week that he had no problem with Mueller testifying. The House Judiciary Committee has been trying to get Mueller to testify about whether Barr mischaracterized the findings in Mueller's report. "No redos for the Dems!" Trump tweeted.

2. **Trump suggested that two years of his presidency have been stolen, and retweeted a call to extend his constitutionally limited time in office.** Trump retweeted conservative pundit Jerry Falwell Jr., who wrote, "I now support reparations — Trump should have 2 yrs added to his 1st term as pay back for time stolen by this corrupt failed coup." Later, Trump echoed Falwell's statements, tweeting that the Democrats "have stollen \[*sic*\] two years of my (our) Presidency (Collusion Delusion) that we will never be able to get back."

1. **The Trump administration deployed an aircraft carrier strike group and a bomber task force to the Middle East as a show of force against Iran.** U.S. officials said the deployment is a response to "clear indications" that Iran and its proxies are planning an attack against U.S. forces. National Security Adviser John Bolton issued a statement that says the U.S. is "not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or regular Iranian forces." Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo provided no details or proof of Iran's actions or intentions, but Pompeo said the move was "something we’ve been working on for a little while."

2. **Trump named the former head of the Border Patrol as the new director of ICE.** Mark Morgan is a former FBI agent who served as head of the Border Patrol during the final months of the Obama administration. He supports Trump's call for a border wall, Trump's decision to declare a national emergency to secure funding for the wall, and the administration's proposal to take migrants caught crossing the border and drop them off in sanctuary cities. Morgan's appointment will require confirmation from the Senate.
