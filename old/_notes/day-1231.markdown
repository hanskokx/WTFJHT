1. **Defense Secretary Mark Esper had "no idea" what Trump was planning when he led Esper and other senior administration officials from the White House to St. John's Episcopal Church for a staged visit**. "I thought I was going to do two things: to see some damage and to talk to the troops," Esper said in an interview. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army Gen. Mark Milley, was also surprised when Trump led the group to the church for a photo op while holding a Bible. "Their understanding is they were going into Lafayette Park to review the efforts of the troops," said one defense official. Esper said he was unaware of Trump's plan to forcefully clear out the crowd of peaceful protesters in the park moments before the group walked through it.

2. **Mitch McConnell blocked a resolution in the Senate condemning the use of tear gas and rubber bullets against peaceful protesters outside the White House in order to allow Trump to walk over to St. John's**. The resolution was introduced by Chuck Schumer. It also affirmed that the First Amendment rights of Americans "must be respected," and that "violence and looting are unlawful, unacceptable and contrary to the purpose of peaceful protests." McConnell said the resolution doesn't deal with the issues Americans want addressed, and instead "indulges in the myopic obsession with President Trump that has come to define the Democratic side of the aisle." McConnell then proposed his own resolution condemning racial injustice and rioting, which Schumer blocked.

3. **The FBI found "no intelligence indicating Antifa involvement/presence" in the violence in D.C. during the George Floyd protests on May 31**. The internal FBI situation report was circulated on the same day Trump announced on Twitter that his administration would designate the group of anti-fascist activists as a terrorist organization, even though the U.S. government does not have the authority to apply that designation to a domestic group. Attorney General William Barr also blamed "Antifa and other similar groups" for the violence and declared that "the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly," despite the assessment to the contrary from his own agents.

4. **Trump and the Republican National Committee will no longer hold their August convention in Charlotte, N.C.** "Would have showcased beautiful North Carolina to the World, and brought in hundreds of millions of dollars, and jobs, for the State," Trump tweeted. Trump blamed Gov. Roy Cooper, accusing him of forcing the RNC to "seek another State to host the 2020 Republican National Convention" after Cooper rejected the GOP's request to hold a full-scale convention without proper health protocols in place.
