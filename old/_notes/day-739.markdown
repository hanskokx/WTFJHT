1. **The Trump administration lifted sanctions against three companies owned by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska.** The Treasury Department originally sanctioned Deripaska, six other oligarchs and their companies in April in response to Russia's "malign activity" around the world. The sanctions against Deripaska himself will remain in effect, but his companies launched a lobbying campaign to argue that the sanctions against aluminum giant Rusal would disrupt the aluminum market and damage U.S. companies. The Russian stock index shot up to an all-time high and shares in Rusal hit their highest since April on Monday in response to the decision. Aluminum prices in the U.S. fell by as much as 1.4 percent after the open.

3. **Roger Stone refused to rule out cooperating with Robert Mueller's team, despite repeatedly pledging his loyalty to Trump during a TV interview.** "You know, that’s a question I would have to -- I have to determine after my attorneys have some discussion," Stone said when asked about the possibility of a cooperation deal with Mueller. "If there’s wrongdoing by other people in the campaign that I know about," Stone said, "which I know of none, but if there is I would certainly testify honestly." Stone also said his attorneys "believe that this indictment is thin as piss on a rock."
