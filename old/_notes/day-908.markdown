1. **Democratic Rep. Al Green says he plans to force a vote on articles of impeachment against Trump by next week**. The move could force the House to consider the measure for the first time, even though House Speaker Nancy Pelosi opposes it. Green cited Trump's racist tweets and statements as the impetus for his call to hold an impeachment vote. "The President of the United States is a racist, a bigot, a misogynist, as well as an invidious prevaricator," Green said. "To say that Donald John Trump is unfit for the Office of the President of the United States is an understatement." Green has forced two votes on impeachment in the past, one in 2017 and one in 2018, both while Republicans controlled the House.

2. **The Trump administration announced on Monday that, effective immediately, all family planning clinics that receive taxpayer funding must stop referring women for abortions**. Health and Human Services formally notified the clinics that it will begin enforcing the new rule, in addition to a requirement that clinics maintain separate finances from facilities that provide abortions. A separate requirement that both kinds of facilities cannot be under the same roof is scheduled to take effect next year.

3. **Trump named healthcare economist Tomas Philipson as the acting chair of his Council of Economic Advisers**. Philipson was already a member of the council, and teaches the economics of healthcare at the University of Chicago. He also served as a top economist at the FDA and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Philipson replaced White House economist Kevin Hassett, who announced his departure on Twitter last month.

4. **The revenue the United States has taken in from the tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods is not enough to cover the cost of Trump's bailout for farmers**, nor will it be enough to compensate all of the other industries hurt by the ongoing trade war. The tariffs will have brought in $20.8 billion as of Wednesday, but Trump has already committed to paying $28 billion to the farmers hurt by the trade war. The government has provided no such bailout to the several other businesses that have lost contracts and revenue as a result of Chinese retaliation for the tariffs.
