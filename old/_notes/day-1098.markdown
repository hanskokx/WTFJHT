1. **The Office of Management and Budget released 192 pages of Ukraine-related documents shortly before the midnight deadline last night**. The documents contain emails from OMB Acting Director Russell Vought and Michael Duffey, associate director for national security at OMB, including an email from Duffey on the day of Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy. The emails are heavily redacted, and the details of what was being discussed within them are almost entirely blacked out. OMB said the heavy redactions are necessary because disclosing the details "would inhibit the frank and candid exchange of views that is necessary for effective government decision making."

2. **Trump claimed that U.S. economic growth would be closer to 4% if it weren't for the rate hikes implemented by the Federal Reserve**. Trump called the hikes "a big blip that should not have taken place," and said the stock market would be even higher — "I could see 5,000 to 10,000 points more on the Dow" — if the Fed hadn't raised rates so quickly before cutting them three times in 2019.

3. **Trump demanded that Apple unlock iPhones and give access to the government in criminal cases**. "They have the keys to so many criminals and criminal minds," Trump said, "and we can do things." Apple has said it refuses to build a "backdoor" or other specialized software to give law enforcement access to its devices. Trump criticized the company last week for turning down government requests to unlock the password-protected iPhones used by the shooter who killed three people in Pensacola, FL in December. "They could have given us that information," Trump said. "It would have been very helpful."
