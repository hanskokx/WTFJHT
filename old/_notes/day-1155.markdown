1. **Two members of Congress tested positive for the coronavirus.** Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and Ben McAdams revealed their test results on Wednesday, making them the first two members of Congress to contract the virus. Balart said he started noticing symptoms on Saturday after voting on the floor of the House to approve the coronavirus response bill. McAdams said his symptoms also began on Saturday night. Rep. Drew Ferguson has also been advised to self-quarantine until March 27 after a House doctor informed him that he had "contact with a member of Congress on March 13th that has since tested positive for COVID-19."

2. **The Department of Agriculture is fighting to implement drastic changes to SNAP benefits, despite a federal judgeâ€™s ruling that it would be "arbitrary and capricious" to move forward during a global health crisis.** The new rules were set to go into effect on April 1, but Judge Beryl Howell ordered a freeze on the changes in a ruling last week. The new rules would eliminate states' ability to waive work and time requirements for SNAP recipients in areas with high unemployment rates. The changes are expected to kick roughly 700,000 people off the program if enacted.

3. **Bank of America: "We are officially declaring that the economy has fallen into a recession."** Bank of America economist Michelle Meyer wrote a note to investors to notify them that the firm expects the U.S. economy to "collapse" in the second quarter and shrink by 12%. They also expect the unemployment rate to nearly double, with a total of roughly 3.5 million jobs lost by the start of Q3. Meyer said she expects a "very slow return to growth thereafter with the economy feeling somewhat more normal by July." She added that while the firm believes the decline will be severe, it will also be "fairly short lived."
