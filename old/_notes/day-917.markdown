1. **Senate Republicans blocked two election security bills and a cybersecurity measure in the wake of Mueller's testimony and warnings about Russia's ongoing attempts to interfere in U.S. elections**. Democrats attempted to pass two bills by unanimous consent that would require campaigns to notify the FBI and the FEC if they receive offers of assistance from foreign governments. The other bill would let the Senate Sergeant at Arms offer voluntary cyber assistance for the personal devices and accounts of lawmakers and their staff. Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith blocked all three of the bills without giving any reason for her objections or indicating whether she blocked the bills on behalf of herself or the GOP caucus.

2. **Trump vetoed three resolutions that would have stopped several U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates**, which Trump initiated without congressional approval. Bipartisan majorities in both chambers of Congress voted to block the more than $8 billion in arms sales. Lawmakers cited the fact that the arms are currently being used by the Saudis to commit human rights violations against civilians in Yemen, and many objected to the notion of rewarding the Saudis in the wake of Jamal Khashoggi's murder.

3. **Trump and his adult children must face part of a lawsuit alleging they used their family name to scam people into joining a multi-level marketing scheme**. A federal judge said the Trumps and their investors in a Trump-endorsed company called American Communications Network could be liable for claims of fraud, false advertising, and unfair competition. The judge also dismissed the racketeering claims at the center of the case brought against Trump and his children. The suit claims the Trumps received millions of dollars in secret payments from 2005 to 2015 in exchange for endorsing ACN and then conned the plaintiffs into believing that Trump thought their investments would pay off, when the Trumps' real goal was simply to enrich themselves.

4. **Trump gave a speech in front of a fake presidential seal that had been edited to look like the Russian coat of arms**. The doctored seal swapped out the traditional bald eagle clutching arrows in its talons for a two-headed bald eagle clutching golf clubs. The two-headed eagle in the middle of the seal was similar to the coat of arms Russia has been using since 1993 and the preeminent symbol of the Russian empire dating all the way back to the 1600s and beyond. The speech took place in front of the doctored seal at a student summit hosted by the conservative group Turning Point USA. It is unclear how the swap was made or who is responsible.
