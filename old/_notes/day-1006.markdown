1. **The top official at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine is set to testify behind closed doors today as part of the House impeachment inquiry**. William Taylor was tapped to run the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine and came out of retirement after Trump abruptly fired Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Taylor was then roped into an effort by the Trump administration to pressure Ukraine for information he could use against his political rivals. The committees conducting the impeachment inquiry want to know whether Trump committed impeachable offenses by pressuring Ukrainian President Zelensky into launching an investigation that could help Trump's campaign by withholding U.S. military aid from Ukraine until Zelensky capitulated.

2. **Trump met with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban over the objections of his national security team just 10 days before a key meeting on Ukraine**. During his meeting with Trump, Orban provided a harsh view of Ukraine. Trump's meeting with Orban was also a factor that helped sour Trump on Zelensky in the months leading up to their July 25 phone call. Neither Orban nor the other leaders Trump spoke to during that time specifically encouraged Trump to see Ukraine as a potential source of damaging information about Biden, nor did they describe Kiev as complicit in an unsubstantiated 2016 election conspiracy theory.

3. **Trump lectured reporters for more than 70 minutes during a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, during which he made at least 20 false or misleading statements**. Trump lied about everything from the number of times Obama unsuccessfully attempted to call Kim Jong Un, to the crowd sizes at his rallies, to his position on the Iraq War, to the ongoing impeachment inquiry. He also claimed that he was personally responsible for the capture of Islamic State soldiers, complained that people were criticizing him for receiving "emoluments" from foreign governments, and insinuated that Adam Schiff gave information to the whistleblower who raised concerns about his administrationâ€™s actions toward Ukraine.

4. **The Pentagon recently began drafting plans for an abrupt withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan in case Trump decides to surprise military leaders** by ordering an immediate withdrawal like he did in Syria. The contingency plan includes the possibility that Trump orders all U.S. troops out of Afghanistan within weeks. Officials said the planning is merely a precaution and that they don't currently have any directive from the White House to pull U.S. troops out of Afghanistan.
