1. **The former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine will testify publicly today as part of the House impeachment inquiry**. Marie Yovanovitch is expected to tell House investigators about how she became the target of a smear campaign by Rudy Giuliani which eventually led to her ouster from the State Department. Yovanovitch had already been removed from her post by the time Trump had his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but she was able to witness the early stages of Trump and Giuliani's efforts to influence Ukrainian policy and pressure Zelensky to investigate Trump's political rivals.

1. **The White House released a rough transcript of Trump's first call in April with Ukrainian President Zelensky**. The call is mostly congratulatory, with Trump expressing confidence in Zelensky's leadership and telling him that the U.S. is "with you all the way." Trump tells Zelensky that he plans to invite him to the White House "when you're settled and ready" because they "have a lot of things to talk about." Trump would later ask Zelensky during the July 25 call to publicly announce investigations into Trump's political rivals.

1. **A longtime Office of Management and Budget official is expected to testify in the impeachment inquiry**. Mark Sandy would be the first OMB official to testify as part of the inquiry, defying Trump's prohibition on administration officials providing testimony to House investigators. Sandy is a career employee who has worked at OMB for more than a decade. Sandy will testify in a closed-door session, where he is expected to provide insight into the $400 million in U.S. military aid that was withheld from Ukraine.

2. **Trump met with Attorney General William Barr and White House counsel Pat Cipollone in the Oval Office on Thursday to discuss the DOJ inspector general's probe into the origins of the Mueller investigation**. Inspector General Michael Horowitz began his investigation in early 2018. His goal is to examine the applications submitted by the FBI in 2016 and 2017 that sought permission to surveil Trump's then-campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page. Barr said Wednesday that the report is "imminent." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/politics/trump-barr-cipollone-horowitz-report/index.html))
