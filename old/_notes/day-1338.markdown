1. **Guidance posted last month on the CDC's website regarding who should be tested for the coronavirus was not written by CDC scientists and was published on the site despite serious objections from the CDC.** The guidance said it wasn't necessary to test people who did not have symptoms of COVID-19 even if they had been exposed to the virus. The Department of Health and Human Services rewrote the guidance and "dropped" it into the CDC's public website, flouting the agency’s strict scientific review process. The guidance was published at a time when public health experts were pushing for more testing rather than less. The guidance also contains "elementary errors," such as referring to "testing for COVID-19," as opposed to testing for the virus that causes it, and recommendations that are inconsistent with the CDC's position. Assistant secretary at HHS Adm. Brett Giroir said the original draft came from the CDC, but that he "coordinated editing and input from the scientific and medical members of the task force."

2. **Dr. Anthony Fauci say he would "take the heat" for any potential problems associated with the rollout of a coronavirus vaccine.** When asked by Chris Hayes on MSNBC whether he could "assure all of us that if the corners have been cut, if there is something sideways or wrong with the process, that you will tell us and take the heat" for that, Fauci replied, "The answer, Chris, is yes." Earlier this week, Fauci said he was confident there would be a "safe and effective vaccine" available by the end of 2020, despite Trump's claims that a vaccine would be widely available before the November election.

3. **Trump once said the coronavirus might be a "good thing" because it means he no longer has to shake hands with "disgusting people,"** according to a former top adviser to Mike Pence. In a new video for the group Republicans Voters Against Trump, Olivia Troye, who served on the White House coronavirus task force, says Trump made the comment during one of the task force meetings she attended. "Maybe this COVID thing is a good thing," Trump said. "I don’t like shaking hands with people. I don’t have to shake hands with these disgusting people." When asked about Troye's claims, Trump said he has never met her and has no idea who she is. "She was on the task force as some kind of a lower-level person," he told reporters. "I have no idea who she is."

4. **The Trump administration will ban WeChat and TikTok from U.S. app stores starting Sunday night.** Americans will be blocked from downloading the Chinese-owned apps due to concerns that they pose a threat to national security. Current users will not see any significant changes and officials from the U.S. Department of Commerce say they will not bar additional technical transactions for TikTok until Nov. 12. order bars Apple Inc’s app store, Alphabet Inc’s Google Play and others from offering the apps on any platform "that can be reached from within the United States." The ban on new U.S. downloads could still be rescinded by Trump before it takes effect.
