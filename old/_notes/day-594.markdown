1. **Trump suggested that protesting should be illegal** after Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing was disrupted by protesters. "I don’t know why they don’t take care of a situation like that," Trump said during an interview. "I think it’s embarrassing for the country to allow protesters. You don’t even know what side the protesters are on." Trump added: "In the old days, we used to throw them out. Today, I guess they just keep screaming." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-suggests-protesting-should-be-illegal/2018/09/04/11cfd9be-b0a0-11e8-aed9-001309990777_story.html?utm_term=.e8e4b1136452))

2. **Trump once again called for a major news network to lose its "license" because he didn't like the coverage.** "NBC FAKE NEWS," Trump tweeted, "which is under intense scrutiny over their killing the Harvey Weinstein story, is now fumbling around making excuses for their probably highly unethical conduct. I have long criticized NBC and their journalistic standards-worse than even CNN. Look at their license?" Trump first suggested pulling NBC's broadcast license last year after the network reported that Trump called for a tenfold increase in the U.S. nuclear arsenal.

3. **Robert Mueller's office has agreed to accept some written answers from Trump**, according to a letter from the special counsels office to Trump's lawyers. The questions would focus on whether his campaign conspired with Russia in its election interference. Mueller is not giving up on an interview altogether, specifically when it comes to questions about possible obstruction of justice.

4. **North Carolina's unconstitutionally gerrymandered congressional maps will be used in the November midterm elections**. A federal court concluded that there is "insufficient time" to redraw the maps before the election, even though the same panel of federal judges ruled in August that the maps favored Republicans and were unconstitutional.

5. **Trump has added FBI Director Christopher Wray to the list of people he doesn't like.** Trump has been criticizing Wray and painting him as yet another Justice Department official who refuses to protect Trump's interests and is possibly out to undermine his presidency. Trump focused his ire on Jeff Sessions and Wray in particular over the Labor Day weekend, with one source claiming that Trump is "in the worst mood of his presidency and calling friends and allies to vent about his selection of Sessions and Wray."
