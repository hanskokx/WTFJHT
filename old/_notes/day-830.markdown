1. **Rep. Jerry Nadler threatened to subpoena Attorney General William Barr if he refuses to testify about the Mueller report before the House Judiciary Committee this week.** Barr disagrees with the committee's proposed format for questioning him, and has threatened to skip the hearing if Democrats don't change the terms of his appearance. Nadler says the committee has no plans to do so. "The witness is not going to tell the committee how to conduct its hearing, period," Nadler said. If Barr doesn't show up, he continued, "we will have to subpoena him, and we will have to use whatever means we can to enforce the subpoena."

2. **Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says trade talks between the United States and China are "getting to the final laps."** An American delegation is heading to Beijing this week to resolve the trade dispute that has been going on for more than a year. Mnuchin says both sides are at a point where the talks will either result in a deal or end with no agreement. Mnuchin is travelling to China today with Trump's top trade negotiator, Robert E. Lighthizer, to try to resolve the remaining disagreements between the two countries. Chinese officials are expected to come to the U.S. on May 8 to hammer out the final details and possibly conclude the negotiations.

4. **A pair of legal watchdog organizations are suing the FEC for failing to act on complaints that claim the NRA illegally coordinated with the Trump campaign** and other Republican candidates in recent elections. The gun-control group Giffords, along with the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center Action, allege that the FEC missed a 120-day deadline to act on four complaints brought by the groups, which claim that the NRA skirted contribution limits to provide unfair advantages to Trump and other GOP candidates.
