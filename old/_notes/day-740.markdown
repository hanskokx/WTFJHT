1. **The U.S. will impose sanctions on Venezuela's national oil company in an attempt to help overthrow Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro and install rival Juan Guaidó.** Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Security Adviser  John Bolton announced that all property of Venezuela's PDVSA within U.S. jurisdiction will be blocked from doing business, and all U.S. citizens are prohibited from trading with the company and its subsidiaries. Revenues earned by Venezuelan companies will also be held in escrow until Guaidó has been installed as the new leader or new elections are held. Russia and China quickly condemned the sanctions and said they completely undermined the international financial system that is already dominated by the U.S. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/28/689292726/u-s-imposes-sanctions-on-venezuelan-state-oil-monopoly) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/29/russia-and-china-condemn-new-us-sanctions-on-venezuela.html) / [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47036491) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/29/new-us-sanctions-on-venezuela-will-mean-cheap-oil-for-china-and-india.html) )

2. **National security adviser John Bolton disclosed what appear to be confidential notes written on a yellow legal pad that included plans to send 4,000 U.S. troops to Colombia as tensions continue to rise in Venezuela.** Bolton held the notepad against his chest with the notes facing outward during a White House briefing announcing new sanctions against Venezuela's national oil industry. When asked about the notes, the White House simply said that "all options are on the table."

3. **Trump accepted Nancy Pelosi's invitation to give the State of the Union address on Feb. 5.** Pelosi sent a letter to Trump inviting him to deliver the address after she rescinded her previous invitation due to security concerns related to the government shutdown. Once the shutdown temporarily ended, negotiations over the State of the Union address began over the weekend.

4. **Roger Stone will appear in federal court today and is expected to plead "not guilty" to charges of obstruction of justice, making false statements to Congress, and witness tampering.** Stone's indictment alleges that he tried to persuade another witness in the Mueller probe to lie to Congress. Stone has appeared on TV several times since his arrest to complain about his treatment by FBI agents and Department of Justice officials. Stone also claims that he had no inside connection to WikiLeaks or that he was part of a conspiracy to help manipulate the 2016 election in Trump's favor.

5. **The Trump administration has started making a new, low-yield nuclear weapon that the Department of Energy claims is designed to counter Russia**. The National Nuclear Security Administration says production of the W76-2 has started at plant in Texas, and is a variant of the Navy's primary submarine-launched nuke, known as the W76-1. The W76-1 is almost seven times as powerful as the bomb the U.S. dropped on Hiroshima, but the W76-2 is believed to be about half as powerful as the Hiroshima bomb. The report claims that smaller nuclear warheads will help balance the threat from Russian forces.
