1. **Trump admitted that he tried to get Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden's son**. On Sunday, Trump told reporters that he spoke on the phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25, during which Trump said he told Zelensky that he didn't want people like Biden and his son adding to the corruption in Ukraine. "The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption," Trump said, "all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son \[contributing\] to the corruption already in Ukraine." Trump also insisted that he did "absolutely nothing wrong" during the call, adding that it was a "perfect" phone call.

* **Did Joe Biden do anything wrong?** The issue here is whether Mr. Biden used his position as vice president to help a Ukrainian energy company that was paying Hunter Biden by pushing for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor. The prosecutor’s office had oversight of investigations into the oligarch who owned the company. No evidence has surfaced that the former vice president intentionally tried to help his son by pressing for the prosecutor’s dismissal.

* **Did Hunter Biden do anything wrong?** Hunter Biden has not been accused of legal wrongdoing related to his work for Burisma, which paid him as much as $50,000 per month in some months for his service on the board of the directors. But he has been criticized by government watchdog groups in the United States and Ukraine for what they characterize as the perception of a conflict of interest, and trading on his family name by allowing it to be used to burnish the reputations of Burisma and Mr. Zlochevsky.

1. **House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff says the House may now have "crossed the Rubicon" when it comes to impeachment** in light of Trump's admission that he pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden's son. Moderate freshman lawmakers who were previously opposed to launching an impeachment inquiry said they were now leaning toward impeachment, while other Democrats who previously expressed tepid support for impeachment have begun amplifying their calls for action.

2. **Conservative leaders are circulating new polling data that suggests a ban on vaping would turn voters against Trump in the 2020 election**. The number of adults who vape living in key battleground states vastly outweighs the margins by which Trump won in those states, and conservative leaders are worried that a ban may cost Trump the election.
