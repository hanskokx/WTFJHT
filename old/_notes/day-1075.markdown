1. **Rudy Giuliani was part of a back-channel effort by the U.S. to remove Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro from power**. Giuliani and then-Rep. Pete Sessions were on the phone with Maduro in Sept. 2018 following a visit by Sessions to Caracas that spring. People familiar with the effort say it was "part of a shadow diplomatic effort, backed in part by private interests, aimed at engineering a negotiated exit to ease President Nicolás Maduro from power and reopen resource-rich Venezuela to business." The phone call between Giuliani and Maduro has not be previously reported, and it provides another example of Trump's personal attorney inserting himself into U.S. foreign policy without specifying whose interests he was representing.

2. **Putin called Trump to thank him for helping to prevent a possible terrorist attack in Russia on New Year's Eve**. American intelligence agencies provided information to Russia's Federal Security Service that led to the arrest of two suspects who were allegedly planning to carry out an attack on a crowded location in St. Petersburg tomorrow evening. No additional information about the planned attack was made public. This is the second time that Putin has called to thank Trump for helping to prevent an attack in St. Petersburg.

3. **Republican Sen. James Lankford says he doesn't think Trump "as a person is a role model for a lot of different youth."** Lankford cited Trump's tweets and "some of the things he says" as reasons why he doesn't think Trump is someone who young people can look up to. "He comes across with more New York City swagger than I do from the Midwest," Lankford continued, "and definitely not the way that I'm raising my kids." Still, Lankford says he continues to support Trump because of his positions on issues that Lankford is "very passionate about," such as abortion and religious liberty for Christians.

4. **The Taliban's ruling council says it has agreed to a temporary ceasefire in Afghanistan** in hopes of reaching a peace agreement with the United States. The U.S. has demanded a ceasefire before any peace agreement negotiations can begin. Taliban officials did not say when the ceasefire would begin and there has been no immediate response from Washington.

5. **The White House warned that it would "take action" if North Korea tests another long-range or nuclear missile**, according to national security adviser Robert O’Brien. O'Brien said the U.S. has "many tools in its tool kit" to respond to a test by Pyongyang. "If Kim Jong Un takes that approach," he continued, "we’ll be extraordinarily disappointed and we’ll demonstrate that disappointment." North Korea recently warned that failure to offer a new initiative regarding Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program could result in an unwanted "Christmas gift" from Kim Jong Un.
