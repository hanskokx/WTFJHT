1. **Trump held an indoor rally on Sunday in Henderson, Nevada, in violation of state regulations and his own administration's pandemic health guidelines.** During the event, Trump told the largely-maskless crowd that the U.S. was "making the last turn" when it comes to defeating the coronavirus. Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak called the rally "an insult to every Nevadan who has followed the directives, made sacrifices, and put their neighbors before themselves," and a "direct threat to all of the recent progress we've made." Temperature checks were given to all rally attendees upon entrance and while masks were encouraged, few people wore them. Trump also held a rally on Saturday on the tarmac of Nevadaâ€™s Minden-Tahoe Airport where most people were not wearing masks or practicing social distancing.

2. **Trump claimed that he received "the highly honored Bay of Pigs award," which doesn't exist.** The Bay of Pigs was a failed attempt by the CIA and Cuban exiles to instigate the overthrow of Fidel Castro. In a tweet attacking Joe Biden, Trump said Biden "spent 47 years in politics being terrible to Hispanics" and is now "relying on Castro lover Bernie Sanders to help him out." He added: "Remember, Miami Cubans gave me the highly honored Bay of Pigs Award for all I have done for our great Cuban Population!" Trump did receive an endorsement in 2016 from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association, which is not an award.

3. **Coronavirus cases are increasing in 11 states by a weekly average of 5% or more.** Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Wisconsin and Wyoming are all seeing rising case counts. While cases in those 11 states are increasing, the overall daily average of new cases in the U.S. is declining. Over the past seven days, the country has reported an average of about 34,300 new cases per day, down more than 15% compared to a week ago.

4. **Politically-appointed communications aides at the Department of Health and Human Services have demanded the right to review and seek changes to the CDC's weekly scientific reports on the progress of the coronavirus pandemic.** Officials have characterized the requests as an attempt to intimidate the reports' authors and water down their communications to health professionals. Some of the emails from communications aides to CDC Director Robert Redfield and other senior officials show the aides openly complaining that the reports would undermine Trump's optimistic messaging about the outbreak. The efforts to change the language in CDC reports have been constant across the summer and continued as recently as Friday afternoon.
