1. **Trump endorsed Mitt Romney's run for a U.S. Senate seat in Utah, and Romney accepted Trump's endorsement.** Romney announced last week that he would run to replace Orrin Hatch, one of many Congressional Republicans who have chosen not to run for reelection this year. [Trump tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/965773283554668544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FrealDonaldTrump%2Fstatus%2F965773283554668544) that Romney “will make a great Senator and worthy successor to @OrrinHatch, and has my full support and endorsement!” Romney has often been critical of Trump and his policies, especially during the 2016 presidential race.

2. **Scott Pruitt's EPA is encountering a wave of legal challenges to his rollback of Obama-era environmental protections and laws.** Pruitt has run into court challenges and legal delays on everything from his rollback of rules preventing dentists from washing excess mercury down the drain to his suspension of rules designed to curb methane emissions from new oil and gas wells.

3. **The new congressional-district map in Pennsylvania gives Democrats a better chance of winning back the House this fall.** Early estimates of the new map, drawn by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, suggest that the number of Trump seats available has dropped from around 13 down to 10 — which could bring the Democrats a few steps closer to securing a majority in the House.

4. **Fox News is launching a new subscription-based streaming service for Fox superfans, and they're calling it "Fox Nation."** The stand-alone subscription service would be available without a cable package, would focus mainly on right-leaning commentary, and would feature original shows and appearances by popular right-wing personalities like Sean Hannity. Fox Nation is expected to launch by the end of the year. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/business/media/fox-news-streaming.html))
