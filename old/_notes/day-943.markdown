1. **Trump appeared to withdraw his support for additional background checks and gun legislation after speaking with gun rights activists and NRA president Wayne LaPierre**. Trump personally spoke to LaPierre on multiple occasions, where LaPierre was said to have voiced his concerns about expanded background checks. LaPierre reportedly claimed that the legislation wouldn't sit well with his supporters. In the wake of the recent back-to-back mass shootings in Ohio and Texas, Trump said "I think background checks are important. I don't want to put guns into the hands of mentally unstable people or people with rage or hate." Now, Trump says he is "very concerned" about the Second Amendment and claims "people don't realize we have very strong background checks right now."

2. **Trump tweeted a doctored photo showing a Trump Tower in Greenland, apparently making light of his idea to buy the world's largest island**. The photo shows a golden-clad Trump Tower looming over a small village in Greenland with the caption, "I promise not to do this to Greenland!" Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has said the autonomous island territory is "not for sale," and said the idea of selling Greenland to the United States was absurd. Trump is scheduled to visit Copenhagen early next month, where he will discuss the Arctic in meetings with PM Frederiksen and Greenland PM Kim Kielsen.

3. **Trump could reportedly abandon some of his tariffs in order to avoid sending the U.S. into a recession**. While Trump insists that the "fundamentals" of the American economy remain firm, and that the tariffs are hurting China and making the U.S. "much richer," he and fellow Republicans worry that a tanking U.S. economy could hurt Trump's reelection chances in the 2020 presidential race.

4. **The White House is mounting an effort to prevent additional states from joining a pact with California and four automakers to oppose Trump's rollback of auto emissions standards**. Representatives from Toyota, Fiat, Chrysler, and General Motors were summoned to the White House last month, where they were pressed by a Trump adviser to stand by Trump's rollbacks. Now, Mercedez-Benz is preparing to join the California agreement. Trump is reportedly "enraged" by the pact, and has demanded that his staffers speed up their efforts to complete his own plan, which is directly at odds with the interests of many automakers. Together, the five automakers — and possibly a sixth to come — account for more than 40% of all cars sold in the United States.
