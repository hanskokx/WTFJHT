1. **Paul Manafort's attorneys are asking for leniency as he faces the possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison for his crimes.** Manafort's attorneys described him in a court filing as a man who has been "personally, professionally, and financially" broken by Mueller's investigation, and as someone who deserves a sentence "significantly" below the statutory maximum of 10 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy charges. Two federal judges will sentence Manafort on two occasions over the next month for criminal charges that include tax and bank fraud, witness tampering, and working as an unregistered lobbyist for a foreign government.

2. **The House is scheduled to vote today on a resolution that would end Trump's national emergency declaration.** Once the measure passes the Democrat-controlled House, it will move on the Senate, where only one more Republican vote is needed for it to pass and land on Trump's desk, where he is expected to veto it. A bipartisan rejection of Trump's declaration from Congress would be a test of the government's constitutional separation of powers. Many GOP lawmakers are reportedly still reluctant to go against Trump.

3. **Trump announced that American citizen Danny Burch has been freed after spending 18 months in captivity in Yemen.** The State Department suggested that Burch was freed as a result of a rescue operation in concert with the United Arab Emirates. Burch lived in Yemen for years working for an oil company and was kidnapped in Sept. 2017 while taking his sons to a local sports club.

4. **A federal judge approved a move by the Trump administration to ban "bump stocks" for firearms**, which allow semi-automatic weapons to be converted to automatic weapons. Opponents say the government does not have the legal authority to enforce the ban. The new rule is set to take effect on Mar. 26, when bump stock owners will be required to turn in or destroy their bump stock attachments. Trump promised to ban bump stocks in the wake of a mass shooting at a music festival in Las Vegas that left 58 people dead in Oct. 2017.
