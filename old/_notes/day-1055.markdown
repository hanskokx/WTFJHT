1. **House Democrats unveiled two articles of impeachment against Trump, charging him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress**. Members of the Judiciary Committee worked through the night to prepare the articles. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reiterated ahead of the release that Trump tried to "corrupt our upcoming elections" and that he remains a "threat to our democracy and national security." Trump, meanwhile, continues to insist that he did "NOTHING" wrong, and that impeaching a president with his record would be an act of "sheer Political Madness!"

2. **Trump is scheduled to meet with the Russian foreign minister today**. The meeting will be Sergei Lavrov's first trip to Washington since his controversial meeting with Trump in 2017, during which Trump divulged classified information to the Russians the day after he fired then-FBI Director James Comey. There are no details on what Trump plans to discuss with Lavrov, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has confirmed that he will also attend today's meeting.
