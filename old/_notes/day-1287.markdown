1. **Trump confirmed that he never confronted Putin about the alleged Russian bounties paid to Taliban fighters to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan.** "I have never discussed it with him," Trump said. Trump spoke with Putin on Thursday of last week and later said, "We don't talk about what we discussed." But when asked again on Tuesday, Trump said he didn't raise the issue because the phone call was meant "to discuss other things" and because "frankly that’s an issue that many people said was fake news." Trump has spoken to Putin at least eight times since the intelligence about the alleged Russian bounties was included in his President's Daily Brief in February.

2. **Trump complained that his approval ratings were lower than Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, wondering aloud why "nobody likes me."** During a White House coronavirus briefing on Tuesday, Trump made several misleading statements and false claims before digressing to discuss Fauci and Birx's high approval ratings. "He’s got this high approval rating,” Mr. Trump said. “Why don’t I have a high approval rating — and the administration — with respect to the virus?" He added: "They’re highly thought of, but nobody likes me. It can only be my personality."

3. **Trump falsely claimed that large portions of the U.S. are "corona-free,"** despite a new federal report that 21 states have outbreaks so severe that they are in the so-called "red zone." 28 states are in the "yellow zone," and only one state, Vermont, is in the "green zone." Trump also defended sharing a misleading video that claimed hydroxychloroquine is a "cure" for the virus, and told reporters that "from a safety standpoint it’s safe."

4. **Twitter temporarily barred Donald Trump Jr. from tweeting and retweeting after he shared a video that contained misinformation about the coronavirus.** The video is the same one his father shared, which touts the drug hydroxychloroquine as a "cure" for the virus. Twitter suspended Trump Jr.'s account for 12 hours and removed the retweet by Trump, but no further action was taken against Trump's account.
