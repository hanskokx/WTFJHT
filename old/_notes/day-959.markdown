1. **A federal judge ruled that 11 parents who were deported from the U.S. without their children will be allowed to return to the country**. San Diego District Court Judge Dana Sabraw ruled that the Trump administration illegally prevented the parents from pursuing their asylum cases. In some cases, the judge found that agents coerced the parents into dropping their claims and accepting deportation by having them sign documents they didn't understand or lying and telling the parents that the asylum laws had changed. Sabraw refused to allow seven other parents listed in the original request to return to the U.S. ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/460034-federal-judge-says-11-parents-separated-from-children-can-return-to))

2. **A district court judge in Virginia ruled that the federal government's database of people deemed to be "known or suspected terrorists" violates the rights of American citizens who are on the watchlist**. Judge Anthony Trenga said "the currently existing procedural safeguards are not sufficient" to address the risk of incorrectly depriving U.S. citizens of their freedom to travel or protect their reputation. The database is a major tool of the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, and the ruling calls the constitutionality of the watchlist into question. As of 2017, roughly 2.1 million people were on the watchlist. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/us/politics/terrorism-watchlist-constitution.html))

3. **The Pentagon will pull funding from 127 Defense Department programs in order to pay for the $3.6 billion in border wall funding**. Some of the programs on the chopping block include schools and daycare centers for military families, as well as funding for roads, maintenance shops, equipment storage buildings and hazardous material warehouses.

4. **Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner will not seek reelection next year, joining more than a dozen other House Republicans who have already announced their retirements**. Sensenbrenner has been a Wisconsin representative since 1978, and has been reelected with more than 60% of the vote in every general election since.

5. **The CEO of General Motors is scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House today**. Mary Barra will meet with Trump to discuss trade issues, ongoing contract talks, and Trump's proposed revisions to fuel efficiency and emissions standards. Last week, Trump went after GM on Twitter, calling on the company to leave China and move its major plants to the United States. GM recently closed four of its plants in the U.S., which is a central issue in its ongoing contract talks with the United Auto Workers union.

6. **The Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by a quarter of a percent later this month**. Trump has pressured the Fed to make additional cuts of up to 1%, but even a half-point cut does not appear to have the support of officials inside the Fed.
