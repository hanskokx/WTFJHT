1. **Trump threatened to increase ICE raids and deportations of undocumented immigrants after the July 4 holiday**. "After July Fourth a lot of people are going to be brought back out," Trump told reporters. "So people that come up maybe here for a short while, but they're going to be gone, they're going back to their countries. They go back home. ICE is going to be apprehending them and bringing them back." Trump praised the Mexican government for taking steps to curb the flow of migrants reaching the U.S. border, claiming, "It was because of tariffs that they're doing it, but the point is they're doing a great job." But he reiterated his threat to deport all undocumented immigrants, "because that's what we do."

2. **Rep. Joaquin Castro snuck a hidden camera into a migrant detention facility and tweeted out photos and videos of the conditions**, saying Americans "must see what is being carried out in their name." The tweets show several women in the custody of Customs and Border Patrol sitting on the floor with blankets at a facility in El Paso. The facility in question housed "women from Cuba, some grandmothers, crammed into a prison-like cell with one toilet, but no running water to drink from or wash their hands with. Concrete floors, cinder-block walls, steel toilets." Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also visited the facility, where she said officers were keeping women in cells with no running water, and had "told them to drink out of the toilets."

3. **The Trump administration missed its own July 1 deadline to print the paper forms for the 2020 U.S. Census**. The materials have yet to be officially approved by the White House's Office of Management and Budget, which is headed by acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. The administration also hasn't reached a final decision on whether or not it will attempt to again make the case in court for adding a citizenship question to the census forms.
