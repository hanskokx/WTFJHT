1. **The White House threatened to veto a nearly $4.7 billion emergency aid package to Puerto Rico**. The $4.67 billion aid package passed by Democrats in the House would include $3.26 billion in community development block grants, $1.25 billion for repairs to roads, and tens of millions more for schools, energy, and nutrition assistance programs. In its veto message to Congress, the Office of Management and Budget called the bill "misguided" and warned that multiple "high-profile cases of corruption have marred distribution of aid already appropriated and have led to ongoing political instability on the island." The bill is not expected to pass in the Senate in its current form.

2. **FBI Director Christopher Wray warned that Russia is still engaged in "information warfare" against the United States heading into the 2020 election**. Wray says Russia is still relying on a covert social media disinformation campaign aimed at sowing division and fracturing American public opinion. Wray did conceded, however, that he hasn't seen "any ongoing efforts to target election infrastructure like we did in 2016," referring to the theft of DNC and Clinton campaign emails.

3. **Republican Sen. Susan Collins walked back her claims that Trump learned a "pretty big lesson" from the impeachment process and will be "much more cautious in the future" when it comes to soliciting foreign assistance in U.S. elections.** A day after voting to acquit Trump of both articles of impeachment, Collins admitted that her initial belief that Trump would show contrition was based on nothing, adding that she had "no conversations with \[Trump\] throughout the trial." When asked why she felt that Trump had learned a lesson, despite his explicit statements and actions to the contrary, Collins said her claims were "more aspirational on my part, it’s more that I hope that he’s listened to the many voices in the Senate who have pointed out that the call was very problematic."
