1. **The New York attorney general's office opened an investigation into four major Trump Organization projects and a failed effort to buy the Buffalo Bills.** New York AG Letitia James issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank for records related to the projects and the attempted purchase in 2014 of the NFL team. The new inquiry was prompted by the congressional testimony of Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, who testified under oath that Trump had inflated his assets in financial statements and provided documents to back up his claims. The inquiry is a civil investigation, not a criminal one.

2. **The attorney who negotiated hush-money payments in 2016 on behalf of Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal says Trump could still be in legal danger for his alleged role in the directing the efforts to silence the women.** Keith Davidson cited the language used by prosecutors in Cohen's indictment, which alleged that Cohen was part of a criminal conspiracy, and said, "by definition, a conspiracy must involve more than one person â€“ so who else could it be?" Davidson says he sat down with investigators for the special counsel for more than 15 hours, during which it "became clear" to him that prosecutors believe the hush-money payments were part of an effort to save Trump's presidential campaign, which would constitute a violation of campaign finance laws.

3. **The U.S. will remove all remaining diplomatic personnel from the embassy in Venezuela this week.** The State Department said the decision "reflects the deteriorating situation in Venezuela," and that "the presence of U.S. diplomatic staff at the embassy has become a constraint on U.S. policy." They gave no additional details about the withdrawal from Caracas or the specific day on which it would occur. Venezuela is currently experiencing a five-day-long blackout that has crippled the nation's ability to export oil, it's main source of revenue, and has made it even harder for residents to find food and water.
