1. **Trump called on Supreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg to recuse themselves from "all Trump, or Trump-related, matters!"** On Twitter, Trump accused Sotomayor of trying to shame other justices into "voting her way" after she issued a dissent that was critical of the Trump administration's legal strategy and the majority on the court for enabling it in the so-called "[public charge](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-health-202/2018/10/10/the-health-202-the-clock-is-ticking-on-stricter-public-charge-rules-for-immigrants/5bbd09641b326b7c8a8d18e8/?tid=lk_inline_manual_15&itid=lk_inline_manual_15)" case. "She never criticized Justice Ginsberg when she called me a ‘faker'," Trump tweeted. "I only ask for fairness," he added, "especially when it comes to decisions made by the United States Supreme Court!" He also called on Ginsberg to recuse herself because "she went wild" during his 2016 campaign.

2. **The Trump administration submitted a $2.5 billion supplemental budget request to Congress to help fight the spread of the coronavirus.** The request would also require increasing Trump's authority to move federal funds around, as Trump did with money for the border wall. The proposal would use hundreds of millions of untouched funds that were meant to fight Ebola, plus $1.25 billion in new funding. More than $1 billion would go toward creating a coronavirus vaccine. House Democrats immediately labeled the request as insufficient and balked at the idea of giving Trump more authority to redirect federal funding as he sees fit.

3. **Trump again claimed the stock market would crash if he loses the 2020 election.** During his trip to India, Trump said the stock market would jump if he is reelected, but warned that "if I don’t win you’re going to see a crash like you’ve never seen before."
