1. **A federal judge blocked the White House's decision to revoke a Playboy reporter's press pass** over a showdown in the Rose Garden with former Trump aide Sebastian Gorka. U.S. District Court Judge Rudolph Contreras granted a preliminary injunction to restore Brian Karem's "hard pass" because reporters weren't given a clear set of rules governing press conduct at events like the one in question in the Rose Garden. Despite objections from the White House press secretary that reporters are required to adhere to general standards of "professionalism" and "decorum," Contreras said that "without any contextual guideposts, ‘professionalism,’ standing alone, remains too murky to provide fair notice here."

2. **A former top Trump official at the Interior Department who oversaw oil and gas drilling on federal lands joined an oil and gas company less than a week after resigning from Interior**. Joe Balash served as assistant secretary for land and minerals management for nearly two years, where he worked to open up the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to development and expand drilling on the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska to the west of the refuge. Now, Balash will be working for Oil Search, a Papua New Guinea-based oil company that is currently developing one of Alaska’s largest oil prospects in years on state lands that are nearby — but not inside — those same federal reserves.

3. **Mitch McConnell reiterated that he is open to bringing gun legislation to the floor of the Senate, but only if Trump supports it**. McConnell said he would be happy to put a bill on the floor if Trump "is in favor of a number of things that he has discussed openly and publicly, and I know that if we pass it it’ll become law." Democrats are urging McConnell to bring the House's universal background checks bill to the floor, which passed last week but has no Republican support.
