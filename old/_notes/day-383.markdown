1. **The House Intelligence Committee voted unanimously to make the Democratic memo public.** The memo rebuts Republican claims that the FBI and Justice Department abused their powers when they surveilled Carter Page. The vote gives Trump five days to review the memo and decide whether or not he will try to prevent its release.

2. **Devin Nunes admitted that the FBI had previously disclosed the political backing of the Steele Dossier**, despite the fact that the Republican memo failed to mention the disclosure. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/05/fbi-footnote-carter-page-warrant-390795))

3. **Trump's lawyers have advised him against sitting down for an interview with Mueller.** His lawyers are concerned that Trump could be charged with lying to investigators under oath if he makes false statements or contradicts himself, which Trump has a history of doing. Refusing to speak to the special counsel under oath would open the possibility that Mueller would subpoena the president to testify in front of a grand jury.

4. **Steve Bannon is not expected to appear before the House Intelligence Committee today**, despite a subpoena demanding his appearance. Bannon could be held in contempt if he fails to comply with the subpoena, escalating an already tense standoff with the committee.
