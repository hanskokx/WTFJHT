1. **Trump told suburban voters in a series of tweets that they "no longer be bothered or financially hurt" by having low-income housing built in their neighborhoods.** He was referring to his recent repeal of the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule, an addition to the 1968 Fair Housing Act requiring local governments that receive federal housing and development funding to account for biased practices and craft a plan to fix them. "Your housing prices will go up based on the market, and crime will go down," Trump tweeted. "I have rescinded the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. Enjoy!" Earlier this month, Trump announced that his administration was replacing the fair housing rule with its own rule, dubbed "Preserving Community and Neighborhood Choice."

2. **Lawmakers are "nowhere close to a deal" on a new round of aid for the economy**, according to White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Meadows also said he expects the $600-per-week enhanced unemployment benefit to lapse as scheduled on July 31 without any action to restore it, and that the two sides are deeply at odds over how to structure the next aid package and how large it should be. Democrats have put forth a $3 trillion package and Republicans have offered a $1 trillion version of their own. Trump, meanwhile, said he prefers a bare-bones package that would send "payments to the people" and protect them from being evicted. "The rest of it, we’re so far apart, we don’t care," Trump said.

3. **House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a mandate that all members wear a face mask while inside the House.** The mandate was announced hours after Rep. Louis Gohmert revealed that he tested positive for COVID-19. Gohmert frequently refused to wear a mask on the House floor. Members and staff will be required to wear masks in the halls of the House," Pelosi said. She added that members and staffers will not be allowed in the House Chamber if they refuse to obey the new mandate.
