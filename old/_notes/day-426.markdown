1. **Trump ignored specific warnings from his national security advisers when he called Vladimir Putin on Tuesday to congratulate him** on his recent election win. A section in Trump's briefing materials was even titled, "DO NOT CONGRATULATE" in all-capital letters. Both Trump and his chief of staff John Kelly are reportedly furious that the confidential briefing warning Trump not to congratulate Putin was leaked to the press.
