1. **Trump threatened to send in the National Guard and have them shoot protesters in Minneapolis in response to the civil unrest that has broken out across the city**. Trump called the protesters "thugs" who are "dishonoring the memory of George Floyd," a black man who was killed in police custody. He added that the military will "assume control" if things get difficult, adding "when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!"

2. **Twitter said Trump's tweet violated the company's rules about glorifying violence and labeled it as such**, but decided to leave the tweet up because Twitter "has determined that it may be in the publicâ€™s interest for the Tweet to remain accessible." The move is the second time Twitter has added a label or message to Trump's tweets, and it comes the same day that Trump signed an executive order seeking to limit the legal protections that are afforded to social media sites like Twitter.

3. **Republicans gave North Carolina's Democratic governor until June 3 to approve their plan to host the Republican National Convention in Charlotte later this year amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic**. In a letter to Gov. Roy Cooper, the RNC laid out a series of precautions and safety measures it would put in place during the convention. "We still do not have solid guidelines from the State and cannot in good faith, ask thousands of visitors to begin paying deposits and making travel plans without knowing the full commitment of the Governor, elected officials and other stakeholders in supporting the Convention," the letter reads. The letter does not indicate whether attendees would be required to wear masks or get tested before entering the arena.
