* Former EPA administrator **Scott Pruitt** had a section in his vetting form titled "allegations of coziness with big energy companies."

* Former Health and Human Services Secretary **Tom Price** had sections in his dossier flagging "criticisms of management ability" and "Dysfunction And Division Has Haunted Price's Leadership Of The House Budget Committee."

* Acting Chief of Staff **Mick Mulvaney** has a striking assortment of "red flags," including his assessment that Trump "is not a very good person."

* The Trump transition team was so worried about **Rudy Giuliani** being chosen as secretary of state that they created a separate 25-page document titled "Rudy Giuliani Business Ties Research Dossier" with copious accounting of his "foreign entanglements."

* The transition team was worried that **Gen. David Petraeus** "Is Opposed to Torture."

* Former Secretary of State **Rex Tillerson** had deep ties to Russia.

* **Kris Kobach**, who was once in the running for homeland security secretary, had “white supremacy” as one of his vulnerabilities.

* **Nikki Haley**, who would go on to be U.N. ambassador, was flagged for saying that Trump is everything "we teach our kids not to do in kindergarten."

1. **The Trump administration is refusing to publicize dozens of taxpayer-funded studies warning about the impacts of climate change**. The studies include a groundbreaking discovery that rice loses vitamins in a carbon-rich environment, a finding that climate change would exacerbate allergy seasons, and a warning to farmers about an expected reduction in the quality of important grasses used to feed and raise cattle. All of the studies were peer-reviewed and cleared through the Agricultural Research Service, one of the world's leading sources of scientific information for farmers and consumers.

2. **The House Oversight Committee will vote on Wednesday to subpoena Kellyanne Conway for testimony related to her violations of the Hatch Act** if she does not voluntarily appear at the committee's hearing. The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from engaging in political activities in their official capacity, and the civil service watchdog known as the Office of Special Counsel determined earlier this month that Conway violated the act by "disparaging Democratic presidential candidates while speaking in an official capacity during television interviews and on social media."
