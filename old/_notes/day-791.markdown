1. **The Florida man who sent pipe bombs to Trump's political enemies is set to plead guilty in Manhattan federal court today.** Cesar Sayoc's change-of-plea hearing was made public last week after a conference call between prosecutors, a judge, and Sayoc's attorneys. By pleading guilty, Sayoc will avoid his trial, which was scheduled for July. Sayoc has been held without bail since he was arrested in late October outside of a South Florida auto parts store. Absent a plea deal, Sayoc could face a mandatory sentence of life in prison. ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/florida-man-who-sent-pipe-bombs-to-media-trump-critics-set-to-plead-guilty/))

2. **The former owner of a Florida spa involved in a prostitution investigation says she didn't sell access to Trump.** Cindy Yang  says the allegations that she is a Chinese agent are false, and that she believes she is being persecuted because of her ethnicity and political party. "I'm Chinese. I'm Republican," she said. "That's the reason the Democrats want to check me." She also said that she hasn't had any contact with members of the Chinese government since she moved to the United States 20 years ago.

Details about the policy and how it would work remain unclear. The White House says Trump will sign the order and make a statement about "improving free inquiry, transparency and accountability on campus" this afternoon.

4. **U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has reportedly released hundreds of migrants from detention facilities along the southern border in Texas due to severe overcrowding**. At least 250 migrants were released on Tuesday and Wednesday. Officials say the releases are necessary due to the recent influx of migrants from Central America. Immigrant advocates said the releases are meant to sow confusion at the border to help make the case for Trump's national emergency declaration.

5. **The Department of Defense Inspector General is investigating the acting Secretary of Defense over reported bias for Boeing.** A spokesperson for the IG's office said they have "decided to investigate complaints we recently received that Acting Secretary Patrick Shanahan allegedly took actions to promote his former employer, Boeing, and disparage its competitors, allegedly in violation of ethics rules." Shanahan said during his testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee that he supported an investigation into the issue, so the IG's office "informed him that we have initiated this investigation."
