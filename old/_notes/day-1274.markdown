1. **Trump replaced his campaign manager with four months to go before the November presidential election.** Brad Parscale became Trump's campaign manager in February 2018, and he will continue to work for the campaign as a senior adviser for data and digital operations. He will be replaced by deputy campaign manager Bill Stepien. Trump announced Parscale's replacement in a statement Wednesday night. Stepien was expelled from former NJ Gov. Chris Christie’s administration in the wake of the intentional lane closures on the George Washington Bridge in 2013 — an episode known as Bridgegate. He was never formally accused of any wrongdoing and ended up joining Trump's 2016 campaign team. A senior campaign adviser said Trump, Pence, and top campaign advisers have been discussing the Parscale move for a number of days.

2. **A top Trump administration official violated federal contracting regulations by directing millions of taxpayer dollars in contracts that ultimately benefited Trump- and GOP-aligned communications consultants**, according to an HHS inspector general report. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services chief Seema Verma only halted the contracts after an investigation by Politico raised questions about their legality. The agency had already paid out more than $5 million to the contractors by the time the contracts were stopped. A 15-month audit by the HHS inspector general found that CMS "improperly administered the contracts and created improper employer-employee relationships" with the contractors. At least eight former White House, presidential transition team, and campaign officials for Trump were hired as outside contractors and paid hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.
