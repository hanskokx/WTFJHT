1. **Trump tweeted a photo on Friday from a classified intelligence briefing that appears to have come from one of the United States' most secretive surveillance satellites**. The capabilities of the kind of satellite in question are such closely guarded secrets that people have been sent to prison for leaking photos from them. Trump defended his decision to tweet the photo: "We had a photo and I released it, which I have the absolute right to do."

2. **Trump suggested that Mike Pence stay at Trump's golf club and hotel in Ireland during his taxpayer-funded trip for a day of meetings, despite the fact that all of the events took place on the other side of the country in Dublin**. "I don't think it was a request, like a command," Pence said. "I think that it was a suggestion." Pence was traveling with his wife, sister, and mother, and was originally scheduled to end his trip at Trump's golf club in Doonbeg. Instead, Pence flew back and forth from Doonbeg to Dublin for his meetings, a more than one-hour flight each way.

3. **A group of Trump allies is trying to raise at least $2 million to investigate reporters and editors at publications Trump doesn't like**. In a fundraising pitch, the group claims it will provide damaging information about reporters and editors to "friendly media outlets," such as Breitbart, as well as traditional media when possible. GOP consultant Arthur Schwartz will be involved with the fundraising effort, along with several others associated with the "loose network" of operatives [identified by the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/25/us/politics/trump-allies-news-media.html) last week. The prospectus for the project says it is "targeting the people producing the news."

4. **The House Judiciary Committee is preparing to hold hearings and call witnesses involved in Trump's hush-money payments to Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels**. Democrats say there is already enough evidence to name Trump as a co-conspirator in the scheme, which resulted in Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen pleading guilty to campaign finance crimes. The renewed inquiry into the hush-money payments will serve as another aspect of the House's months-long consideration of whether or not to draft articles of impeachment against Trump.

5. **Trump refused to retract his claim that Hurricane Dorian was poised to hit Alabama, even though the National Weather Service said he was wrong**. "They made a big deal about this when in fact, under certain original scenarios, it was in fact correct that Alabama could have received some 'hurt,'" Trump tweeted without citing evidence for the claim. The NWS office in Birmingham on Sunday unambiguously rejected Trump's assertion that Alabama was in the storm's path.
