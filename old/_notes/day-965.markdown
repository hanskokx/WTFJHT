1. **Republicans in Iowa and New Hampshire have promised not to cancel their caucus** and primary for 2020 even as GOP leaders in other states have canceled party elections to help clear the way for Trump's reelection. GOP officials in New Hampshire said that "under no circumstances" will they ever cancel the state's primary election, "whether there’s token opposition or a serious contest." Iowa Republicans said it was "never even up for discussion." ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/3cf0a814468b4aa9bc1679aae61fe1ae))

2. **Trump posted a photo of a "Trump 2024" campaign sign on Twitter and Instagram**, joking once again that he is interested in serving more than two terms. Trump has made the joke in various forms on several different occasions, including earlier this year when he suggested that he would be [president forever](https://people.com/politics/donald-trump-suggests-stay-president-forever-video-endorsing-2020-campaign/).

3. **Trump called on the "boneheads" at the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to "ZERO, or less"** and once again blamed the Fed for a slowing U.S. economy. Trump also called on the Fed to "start to refinance our debt." There is no modern precedent for the refinancing of federal debt. The U.S. is currently $22.5 trillion in debt, $16.7 trillion of which is owed by the public. The federal debt burden has grown by 13% – $2.6 trillion – under Trump, due in part to the 2017 tax cut Trump pushed through Congress.
