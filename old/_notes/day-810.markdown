1. **At least two to four more high-ranking officials affiliated with Kirstjen Nielsen are expected to leave the Department of Homeland Security soon.** All of them — including Lee Francis Cissna, head of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services; Kathy Nuebel Kovarik, one of Cissna's top deputies; and DHS general counsel John Mitnick, the department’s general counsel and a senior member of Ms. Nielsen’s leadership team — are seen by Stephen Miller as impediments to Trump's immigration policies.

2. **Senior GOP Senator Chuck Grassley warned Trump not to oust any more top immigration officials.** Grassley said he was "very, very concerned" about reports that Cissna could be the next to go in Trump's latest DHS purge. "The president has to have some stability and particularly with the number one issue that he’s made for his campaign, throughout his two and a half years of presidency," Grassley said. "He’s pulling the rug out from the very people that are trying to help him accomplish his goal." Grassley also texted acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to express his concerns about removing Cissna, but "he didn’t seem to know who I was talking about," Grassley said.

3. **Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that Trump designated the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization at his request.** "Thank you for responding to another of my important requests," Netanyahu tweeted, "which serves the interests of our countries and countries of the region."

4. **The FBI confirmed that James Comey was a witness in the Mueller investigation.** Specifically, the Bureau was interested in the contemporaneous notes Comey took during his meetings with Trump. The FBI confirmed in a court filing that it was concerned that revealing any details about Comey's meeting memos might allow other people who knew about those conversations to "try to hide or fabricate information."
