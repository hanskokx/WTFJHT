1. **Trump paid no income taxes during 10 of the last 15 years, and he only paid $750 in 2016 and 2017.** He also received a $72.9 million tax refund which is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. Many of his signature businesses, including his golf courses, reported losing large sums of money — losses that have helped to lower his tax bills. While reporting such large losses, Trump also managed to maintain a lavish lifestyle by claiming deductions on personal expenses, including his residences, aircraft, and $70,000 in hairstyling for TV appearances. Trump also owes more than $300 million in loans, for which he is personally responsible, that are due to be repaid within the next four years. As president, Trump has received more money from foreign sources and U.S. interest groups than previously known. The records, however, do not reveal any previously unreported connections to Russia. In response to the reports about his finances, an attorney for the Trump Organization said that "most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate," but only took direct issue with the amount of taxes Trump had paid. Trump said the reporting was "totally fake news" and "made up," but then acknowledged that he "didn't know anything about the story" ahead of its publication.

2. **Trump initially wanted to name his daughter Ivanka as his running mate**, according to a forthcoming book by former Trump campaign deputy Rick Gates. Trump repeatedly brought up the prospect of naming Ivanka as his VP pick, so much so that his campaign polled the idea twice. "I think it should be Ivanka. What about Ivanka as my VP?" Trump said. "She’s bright, she’s smart, she’s beautiful, and the people would love her!" Ivanka was reportedly the one who told Trump that it wasn't a good idea to pick her. Mike Pence was ultimately selected as Trump's running mate only after he delivered a "vicious and extended monologue" about Bill and Hillary Clinton.

3. **A third federal judge ordered the U.S. Postal Service to halt changes that have causes nationwide mail delays.** U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan in D.C. agreed with previous ruling that the changes are likely to risk the timely delivery of election mail and hinder state responses to the novel coronavirus pandemic. Sullivan said it is "clearly in the public interest to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, to ensure safe alternatives to in-person voting, and to require that the USPS comply with the law." Sullivan found that USPS has removed 711 high-speed sorting machines around the country this year, a nearly 15 percent reduction in capacity, or about 30 million pieces of paper mail per hour.

4. **Trump's former campaign manager was taken from his home in Florida by police and involuntarily committed to a hospital for evaluation.** Brad Parscale's wife called the police and reported that he was armed and threatening suicide. Police arrived and took him to Broward Health Medical Center under Florida's Baker Act, which allows police to detain and commit a person who is potentially a threat to himself or others.
