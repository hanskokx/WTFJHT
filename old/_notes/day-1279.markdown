1. **Trump is preparing to send federal agents into Chicago to quell ongoing protests over racism and police brutality.** The Department of Homeland Security is currently drafting plans to deploy roughly 150 agents into the city this week. The agents will be tasked with assisting other federal law enforcement and Chicago police officers, though no specific plan for what the agents will do — or what they will be prohibited from doing — has been made public. Trump also threatened to send agents to other major cities controlled by Democrats. "We’re sending law enforcement," he said. "We can’t let this happen to the cities." During an unrelated press conference, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot expressed concerns about the possibility of Trump sending federal agents to Chicago after unidentified federal agents in Portland were recorded snatching protesters off the streets and taking them away in unmarked vans. "We don’t need federal agents without any insignia taking people off the streets and holding them, I think, unlawfully," Lightfoot said.

2. **Senate Republican leaders vowed to fill any Supreme Court vacancy should one become available, even if the vacancy occurs after the November election.** When asked if the Senate would fill a vacancy even during the lame-duck session after the presidential election, Sen. John Thune said, "We will. That would be part of this year. We would move on it." Sen. Josh Hawley said the difference between 2016, when Republicans blocked Obama's nominee Merrick Garland, and now is that Obama couldn't run again but Trump is on the ballot trying to win a second term.
