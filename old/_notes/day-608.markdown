1. **The Trump administration is unable to account for nearly 1,500 additional migrant children who were placed with sponsors after leaving federal shelters.** The revelation comes months after a similar admission in April by the Department of Health and Human Services that the government lost track of 1,475 migrants children who were moved out of shelters last year. Since 2016, HHS officials have called sponsors to check on children 30 days after they are placed, but the department has said it can not be held legally responsible for children after they are released from government custody.
