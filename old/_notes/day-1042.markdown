1. **Trump knew about the existence of the whistleblower complaint when he decided to unfreeze military aid to Ukraine in September**. Attorneys from the White House counsel's office told Trump about the complaint and said they were in the process of determining whether they were legally obligated to report the complaint to Congress. It is unclear how what level of detail about the complaint was given to Trump by the attorneys. Whistleblower complaints like the one in question are usually submitted to lawmakers with oversight of U.S. intelligence agencies, and the inspector general for the intelligence community suggested that the Trump administration hand it over. But White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his deputy John Eisenberg disagreed and said the Trump administration could withhold the complaint from Congress because they were protected by executive privilege. The Office of Legal Counsel ultimately agreed with Cipollone. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/26/us/politics/trump-whistle-blower-complaint-ukraine.html))

2. **Two officials at the White House Office of Management and Budget resigned earlier this year in part due to their concerns about Trump's decision to withhold military aid to Ukraine**. Career OMB employee Mark Sandy told House investigators during a closed-door interview this month that one of the former OMB officials "expressed some frustrations about not understanding the reason for the hold" before stepping down in September. A second official working in the legal division of OMB offered a "dissenting opinion" over the legality of the hold before resigning shortly thereafter. Neither official has been identified, and it is unclear how closely their resignations were tied to the hold on U.S. military aid.

3. **Trump denied telling Rudy Giuliani to go to Ukraine to dig up dirt on Trump's political rivals**. When asked if he directed Giuliani to go to Ukraine, Trump denied giving the order. "No, I didnâ€™t direct him," Trump said, "but he is a warrior, he is a warrior." Giuliani, however, has publicly admitted that he went to Ukraine on Trump's behalf to conduct an investigation "concerning 2016 Ukrainian collusion and corruption." Giuliani also said the investigation was carried out "solely as a defense attorney to defend my client against false charges." When asked what Giuliani was doing in Ukraine, Trump deferred to Giuliani and said, "Rudy has other clients, other than me." He added: "He's done a lot of work in Ukraine over the years."
