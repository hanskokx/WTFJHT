1. **More than 1.1 million people filed for unemployment last week after briefly dipping below a million the week before.** Jobless claims have come in over the one million mark for 21 out of the last 22 weeks. The unadjusted data, which some economists say is more relevant during times of extreme unemployment, rose by 6.3%, coming in at more than 891,000. More than 28 million people filed for continuing unemployment benefits as of August 1, a drop of 198,000 from the previous week.

2. **The Trump administration is moving forward with a plan to sell F-35 fighter jets and advanced armed drones to the United Arab Emirates.** The UAE is currently working with the Trump administration on a plan to formalize diplomatic ties with Israel. American officials say the new push to sell the advanced weapons is not a direct reward for the Emirati role in any particular diplomatic breakthrough, but they did not deny that it comes as a result of the broader diplomatic effort to forge official ties between the two Middle Eastern nations. Some parts of the Israeli government have voiced concerns about the sale, and Congress is unlikely to approve it without the support of the Israeli government.

3. **Trump praised supporters of the QAnon internet conspiracy theory and said he's heard "they like me very much."** Trump claimed that he doesn't know much about the fringe conspiracy theory — which baselessly alleges that a powerful cabal of sex traffickers within the "deep state" is engaged in a global fight to take down Trump — but said that he's "heard that it is gaining in popularity and from what I hear ... these are people that don't like seeing what's going on in places like Portland, and places like Chicago and New York and other cities and states." He added: "I've heard these are people that love our country and they just don't like seeing it."

4. **Obama called out and criticized Trump by name during his speech at the Democratic National Convention.** He said Trump had "no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends." He also said Trump had "no interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves." He accused Trump of failing to "discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care" after nearly four years in office, adding, "Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t." Trump responded on Twitter: "WHY DID HE REFUSE TO ENDORSE SLOW JOE UNTIL IT WAS ALL OVER, AND EVEN THEN WAS VERY LATE? WHY DID HE TRY TO GET HIM NOT TO RUN?"
