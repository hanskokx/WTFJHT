1. **Trump ordered major changes to U.S. asylum policies that would charge fees to apply for refugee status and ban anyone who crossed the border illegally from obtaining a work permit.** The order was announced in a presidential memo and gives courts a maximum of 180 days to adjudicate asylum claims, which usually take years to process due to a massive backlog. "If the Democrats donâ€™t give us the votes to change our weak, ineffective and dangerous Immigration Laws," Trump tweeted after the memo was released, "we must fight hard for these votes in the 2020 Election!"

2. **Trump and his family are suing Deutsche Bank and Capital One in order to block subpoenas from House Democrats seeking Trump's financial records.** Trump's attorneys argue that the subpoenas serve "no legitimate or lawful purpose" and were issued to harass Trump and "rummage through every aspect of his personal finances, his businesses, and the private information of the President and his family." House Democrats responded to the suit, calling it a "meritless lawsuit" that was "only designed to put off meaningful accountability as long as possible." The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Trump, Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, and the Trump Organization. Deutsche Bank and Capital One intend to begin providing documents to the House on May 6, absent court intervention.

3. **The Trump administration is pushing to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a foreign terrorist organization.** The White House directed national security and diplomatic officials to find ways to sanction the group after Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who sees the Muslim Brotherhood as a source of political opposition, visited Washington, D.C. on April 9. The designation would entail wide-ranging political and economic sanctions against the group, as well as travel restrictions on companies and individuals who interact with them. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump is consulting with his national security team and that the designation is "working its way through the internal process."
