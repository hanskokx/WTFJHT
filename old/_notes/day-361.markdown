1. **Jeff Flake will criticize Trump's use of the term "enemy of the people" to describe the media as Stalinist** in a speech on the Senate floor this week. The Arizona Senator will also criticize the White House for its "unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press."

2. **Trump told reporters that he was "not a racist" and insisted that he didn't call African countries "shitholes"** as part of a discussion on immigration with lawmakers last week. Two Senators at the meeting confirmed that reported comments were accurate. Trump, meanwhile, defended himself:  "I'm not a racist. I am the least racist person you have ever interviewed, that I can tell you."

3. **Trump disputed a report that he has a good relationship with Kim Jong Un**, claiming a Wall Street Journal quote was inaccurate. "I probably have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un," Trump [told the Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/transcript-of-donald-trump-interview-with-the-wall-street-journal-1515715481). Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/952525384242876416) in response: "Obviously I didn't say that. I said 'I'd have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un,' a big difference. Fortunately we now record conversations with reporters ... and they knew exactly what I said and meant. They just wanted a story. FAKE NEWS!"
