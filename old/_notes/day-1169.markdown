1. **Dr. Anthony Fauci has been receiving threats to his personal safety, leading the government to step up his security as the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread across the U.S.** In addition to the threats, Fauci has also received several unwelcome communications from people who intensely admire him. The exact nature of the threats and messages sent to Fauci remains unclear, but HHS Secretary Alex Azar has grown concerned about Fauci's safety as his profile has continued to grow and he's faced more fervent criticism online as the face of the U.S. government's response to the pandemic. As a result, Azar asked the U.S. Marshals Service to deputize agents at the HHS inspector general's office to provide protective services for Fauci.

2. **The Secret Service signed a $45,000 contract this week to rent a fleet of golf carts in Northern Virginia**. According to federal contracting data, the Secret Service says it needs the golf carts to protect a "dignitary" in Sterling, Virginia — home to one of Trump's golf clubs. The contract was signed on Monday and went into effect on Wednesday, providing the Secret Service with 30 golf carts until the end of September. The contract was described as an "emergency order" and, while it doesn't mention Trump or his golf club by name, it closely mirrors previous contracts signed for agents accompanying Trump to his golf clubs in New Jersey and Florida.
