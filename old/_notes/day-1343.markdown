1. **Since September 2018, the Department of Homeland Security has awarded more than $6 million in contracts to the consulting firm where acting secretary Chad Wolf's wife is an executive.** Hope Wolf is vice president of professional staff operations at the consulting firm, Berkeley Research Group. The firm has received federal contracts in the past, but hadn't done any work for DHS until after Chad Wolf became chief of staff at the TSA in 2017. A DHS spokesperson said Wolf was not aware of the contracts until he was contacted by the media. Berkeley Research Group's contracts with DHS are for "Information Technology Software," according to the federal government website USA Spending, but it is not known what specific software was provided or to what component of DHS. Chad Wolf's confirmation hearing before the Senate is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/dhs-awarded-6-million-contracts-firm-where-acting-secretary-wolf-n1240773))

2. **The House passed legislation to fund the government through Dec. 11 and avoid a government shutdown.** Funding was set to expire in eight days, but House Democrats reached a deal with Republicans and passed a stopgap funding measure with a 359-to-57 vote. Republicans and the White House agreed to "increased accountability" over a $30 billion aid package for famers in exchange for nearly $8 billion in "desperately needed nutrition assistance for hungry schoolchildren and families."

3. **Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer invoked the "two-hour rule" on Tuesday in order to prevent Republicans from rushing through a vote to confirm Trump's pick to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.** The rule prohibits any Senate committee or subcommittee from meeting after the Senate has been in session for two hours or after 2 p.m. Schumer said he invoked the rule because "we can't have business as usual when Republicans are destroying the institution as they have done." Senate Democrats will not be invoking the rule today because they don't want do prevent the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee or the Intelligence Committee hearings from going forward.

4. **The Department of Justice says it won't send any senior officials to testify before Congress over the next two weeks because of the way Democrats treated Attorney General William Barr at a hearing in July.** In a letter to the House Judiciary Committee, the DOJ accused Democrats of "scolding and insulting the Attorney General" during a July 28 hearing, as well as repeatedly interrupting him and refusing to let him answer questions. On Twitter, Judiciary Committee chair Jerry Nadler accused Barr of "trying to pick a fight" with his committee in order to "change the subject from the President's disastrous handling of the pandemic, and set a new standard for sheer arrogance and open contempt of Congress." He added: "We will plan accordingly." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/23/politics/doj-refuse-officials-judiciary-committee-hearings/index.html))
