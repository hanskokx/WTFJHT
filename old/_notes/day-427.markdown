1. **Jeff Sessions is telling prosecutors to seek the death penalty in drug-related cases whenever it's "appropriate."** The move comes less than a week after Trump called for the execution of opioid dealers and traffickers. “In the face of all of this death, we cannot continue with business as usual,” Sessions wrote in a memo to U.S. Attorneys offices.

2. **Washington D.C. and Maryland filed a lawsuit against Trump for violating the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution**, which prohibits public officials from receiving gifts and payments from foreign governments without approval from Congress. The suit claims that Trump's refusal to divest from his personal businesses has allowed foreign governments to pay the Trump Organization directly for bookings and events. The suit also claims that businesses in Maryland and D.C. have lost out on potential earnings because groups are choosing to stay at Trump's properties in the hopes that it will gain favor with the president.

3. **House Democrats are attempting to force a vote on a bill that would protect special counsel Robert Mueller in the event that Trump tries to have him fired**. Steve Cohen filed a petition on Wednesday to call for a vote on a bill called the Special Counsel Integrity Act, which would prevent anyone from firing Mueller without just cause. "Recent events particularly concern me," Cohen wrote in a statement, "because it seems the President fears that Mueller is close to revealing findings relevant to his mandate and that ending the investigation is the only way to prevent its public release."

4. **Kellyanne Conway seems poised to take over as White House communications director in the wake of Hope Hicks' departure** earlier this month, according to sources who have spoken with her.

5. **Trump tweeted that he would beat Joe Biden in a fight** in response to Biden's suggestion that he would "beat the hell out of" Trump if they were in high school together. "Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy," Trump tweeted early this morning. He continued: "Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault. He doesn’t know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. Don’t threaten people Joe!" ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/22/politics/donald-trump-joe-biden/index.html))
