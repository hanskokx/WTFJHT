1. **Devin Nunes is planning to send eight criminal referrals to Attorney General William Barr this week.** Nunes did not reveal who he is planning to refer, but he did say that five of the referrals are related to lying to Congress, misleading Congress, and leaking classified information. Nunes said the remaining three referrals are related to allegations of lying to the court that approves surveillance warrants, manipulating intelligence, as well as a "global leak referral," which is not aimed at any single person. Nunes said the referrals were "pretty clear, but as of right now this is, this may not be all of them, but this cleans up quite a bit."

2. **Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned her position on Sunday and Trump confirmed her resignation via tweet.** "Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position," Trump tweeted, "and I would like to thank her for her service." Nielsen will remain in her position until Wednesday, when she will be replaced by U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan, who will take over as acting DHS Secretary until Trump appoints a permanent replacement. Nielsen's departure is part of an overhaul of the DHS directed by immigration hardliner Stephen Miller. It is unclear whether Nielsen decided to resign voluntarily or if she was forced out.
