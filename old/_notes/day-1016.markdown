1. **A judge is expected to reconsider whether an associate of Rudy Giuliani should remain on house arrest while he awaits trial for charges of illegally funneling money into a pro-Trump election committee** and to other politicians. Igor Fruman's attorney is scheduled to appear before U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken in Manhattan to argue that Fruman should not be subject to house arrest or electronic GPS monitoring as conditions of his bail, calling the restrictions "onerous." Fruman was arrested at the airport while attempting to leave the country with his alleged co-conspirator, Lev Parnas, but Fruman's attorney argues that Fruman does not pose a flight risk because he has already paid his $1 million bond and agreed to have his travel restricted.

"At some point, I’m going to sit down, perhaps as a fireside chat on live television," Trump said in an interview, "and I will read the transcript of the call, because people have to hear it. When you read it, it’s a straight call."
