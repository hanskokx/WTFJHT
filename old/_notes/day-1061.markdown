1. **Sen. Chuck Schumer called for former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to testify as witnesses in the Senate impeachment trial**. In a letter to Mitch McConnell, Schumer outlined a number of procedural demands that Democrats say will make the Senate trial more fair. In addition to Mulvaney and Bolton, Schumer also called for testimony from Robert Blair, one of Mulvaney's senior aides, and Michael Duffey, a top official from the Office of Management and Budget. Under Schumer's proposal, the trial proceedings would begin on Jan. 6 and House impeachment managers would begin making their case on Jan. 9.
