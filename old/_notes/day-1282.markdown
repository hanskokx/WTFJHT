1. **Trump canceled the in-person portion of the Republican National Convention as the coronavirus continues to spread across the U.S.** The event was supposed to be held in Jacksonville, FL next month after North Carolina officials said they could not guarantee such an event in Charlotte. But Trump said at a press conference last night that "the timing for this event is not right, just not right with what’s happened recently." He cited the "flare-up in Florida" of coronavirus cases and said "I have to protect the American people." Trump has repeatedly downplayed and denied the dangers of large gatherings over the last few months and accused Democrats of “purposely” keeping their states closed for political advantage. Trump said he still plans to give an acceptance speech of some kind, but it won't be done in person. The formal nominating process, scheduled to take place in Charlotte with about 300 Republican officials, will proceed as planned.

2. **Trump said he is willing to send as many as 75,000 federal agents into U.S. cities as part of his "surge" against "violent crime."** Trump told Fox News that he would would dispatch "50,000, 60,000 people" into American cities, but eventually upped the number to 75,000. "We'll go into all of the cities, any of the cities. We're ready," he said. Trump first said the federal government would "have to be invited in," but added suggested that a lack of invitation wouldn't prevent him from deploying federal agents. "At some point we'll have to do something much stronger than being invited in," he said. According to a 2019 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, there were only around 100,000 federal law enforcement officers in the entire country in 2016.

3. **China ordered the United States on Friday to close its consulate in the western city of Chengdu.** The move is retaliation against the U.S. after Trump ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, TX.
