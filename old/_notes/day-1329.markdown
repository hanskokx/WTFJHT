1. **The Senate returned from its August recess with no indication of progress toward a new coronavirus relief package.** Senators are scheduled to head back to their home states in a few days to campaign for their seats. White House and Democratic congressional leaders have been engaged in negotiations over the next coronavirus bill for weeks, but a bipartisan compromise before the election is still considered unlikely. Senate Republicans introduced their proposal on Tuesday, and Mitch McConnell said he plans to "set up a floor vote as soon as this week." The $500 billion-plus GOP proposal includes $300-per-week federal unemployment payments on top of regular state benefits, another round of funding to aid small and medium-sized businesses, liability protections for businesses, schools and charities, and $105 billion for education, among other provisions.

2. **Trump said he's "taking the high road" by not meeting with top Democrats to discuss the next coronavirus relief package.** House Democrats and the White House have made no progress on a potential deal as tens of millions of Americans remain on unemployment and the U.S. death toll approaches 190,000. "I don't need to meet with them to be turned down," Trump told reporters. "They don't want to make a deal because they think if the country does as badly as possible ... that's good for the Democrats." He added: "I am taking the high road. I'm taking the high road by not seeing them." ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/trump-coronavirus-stimulus-deal-583940e0-0511-4e23-8acf-282158003c40.html))

3. **Dr. Anthony Fauci said a coronavirus vaccine probably won't be ready before the November election.** Fauci said it's more likely that a vaccine will be ready by "the end of the year." Drug manufacturers Moderna and Pfizer are currently attempting to complete patient enrollment for their late-stage vaccine trials by the end of September. Trump, on the other hand, suggested at a press conference Monday that a vaccine could be ready for distribution by Election Day. "We could have a vaccine soon, maybe even before a very special day. You know what day I’m talking about," Trump said. The CDC has asked governors and health departments to prepare to distribute a vaccine as soon as Nov. 1, just two days before the election, and FDA Commisioner Dr. Stephen Hahn has said the agency is prepared to bypass the full federal approval process in order to make a vaccine available as soon as possible.

4. **White House officials have spoken to Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie about taking over at the Pentagon if Trump decides to fire Defense Secretary Mark Esper.** Trump and Esper have repeatedly clashed over a variety of issues both publicly and privately in the last several months. Two senior administration officials said Trump discussed the position directly with Wilkie at the White House last month, and two other senior administration officials said Wilkie had senior-level discussions with the White House about becoming Trump's next defense secretary. The conversations included the possibility of naming Wilkie as acting defense secretary if Trump fires Esper. Another official, however, said there are currently "no plans to replace Secretary Esper."

5. **Postmaster General Lousi DeJoy orchestrated additional compensation for employees at his former business who had made political contributions to GOP candidates and instructed managers to award bonuses to specific individuals based on those contributions.** While serving as head of New Breed Logistics and as a top Republican fundraiser, DeJoy pressured employees to write checks and attend fundraisers for Republicans at his mansion beside a country club in North Carolina. DeJoy would then instruct payroll employees to give bonus payments to those staffers to help defray the cost of their contributions. "Louis was a national fundraiser for the Republican Party. He asked employees for money. We gave him the money, and then he reciprocated by giving us big bonuses," said DeJoy’s longtime director of human resources, David Young. Another former employee said DeJoy "would ask employees to make contributions at the same time that he would say, ‘I’ll get it back to you down the road.’” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/louis-dejoy-campaign-contributions/2020/09/06/1187bc2c-e3fe-11ea-8181-606e603bb1c4_story.html))

6. **The House Committee on Oversight and Reform plans to open an investigation into Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and called for his immediate suspension** following accusations that he reimbursed employees for campaign contributions they made to his preferred GOP politicians. Committee chair Carolyn Maloney said in a statement that DeJoy may have lied to the panel under oath and urged the Board of Governors of the U.S. Postal Service to immediately suspend DeJoy, whom she said "they never should have hired in the first place." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/louis-dejoy-house-investigation/2020/09/07/d13be1ae-f175-11ea-bc45-e5d48ab44b9f_story.html))

7. **The Justice Department moved to intervene in a defamation lawsuit brought against Trump by author E. Jean Carroll, who has accused Trump of raping her in a Manhattan department store in the 1990s.** The DOJ argued that under the Federal Tort Claims Act, or FTCA, the Justice Department can replace Trump's private legal team with a team of government lawyers to defend him. The FTCA also gives federal government employees immunity from lawsuits. Attorneys for the Justice Department argue that Trump was acting in his official capacity as president when he denied ever knowing Carroll and could therefore be defended by government lawyers, who are funded by taxpayer money. The motion also effectively protects Trump from any potentially embarrassing disclosures in the midst of his re-election campaign. It is unusual for the Justice Department to intervene in a private legal matter on behalf of a sitting president.
