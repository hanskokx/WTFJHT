1. **The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can continue to bar most Central American migrants from seeking asylum in the U.S. while a legal battle over the issue plays out in the lower courts**. The Court issued a brief, unsigned order that says the administration can enforce new rules that generally forbid asylum applications from migrants who have traveled through another country on their way to the United States without being denied asylum in that country. A separate lawsuit to overturn the new rules is still working its way through the lower courts, but the rules will be allowed to remain in effect while that case is being decided.

2. **The U.S. government concluded within the last two years that Israel was most likely behind the cell-phone surveillance devices found near the White House** and other sensitive locations in the area. The devices were likely intended to spy on Trump, according to senior U.S. officials, but it is unclear whether the attempts were successful. When Trump administration officials found out about the devices they did not rebuke Israel, as is usually the case when incidents of foreign spying are discovered on U.S. soil. "It was pretty clear that the Israelis were responsible," said one former U.S. intelligence official. A spokesperson for the Israeli Embassy called the claims "absolute nonsense," and insisted that "Israel doesnâ€™t conduct espionage operations in the United States, period."
