1. **The president of Iran called the White House "mentally retarded" and promised that Iran wouldn't be intimidated by new U.S. sanctions**. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson also said Trump's "fruitless sanctions" against Iran's leadership would lead to “the permanent closure of the road of diplomacy” between the U.S. and Iran. Trump's new round of sanctions against Iran are meant to be a response to the downing of a U.S. surveillance drone over the Gulf of Oman, and what John Bolton says is Iran's "malign behavior worldwide." Washington and Tehran remain in a deadlock, despite Trump's last-minute decision to call off a military strike against Iran.

2. **Trump again denied the rape allegations against him by former advice columnist E. Jean Carroll, saying "she's not my type."** Carroll says that a friendly encounter with Trump in a department store in 1995 or 1996 turned violent when Trump pushed her up against a dressing room wall and raped her. Trump says Carroll is "totally lying" about the incident. "I’ll say it with great respect: Number one, she’s not my type," Trump said. "Number two, it never happened."

* **Report: New York Post deletes story about rape allegation against Trump at behest of Trump-loving editor.** Col Allan — a former Post editor-in-chief and top Rupert Murdoch lieutenant who has returned to the paper in an effort to make it even more friendly to the president — ordered stories about E. Jean Carroll’s rape claim scrubbed from the Post’s website.

Commerce Department lawyers instructed Wilbur Ross' senior adviser and counsel James Uthmeier not to answer the committee's questions about his contacts with the White House or his conversations with Ross regarding the citizenship question. Uthmeier was also directed not to discuss the contents of a memo he wrote outlining legal arguments for the addition of the citizenship question.

2. **Trump recently told confidants that he is thinking about withdrawing the U.S. from a longstanding defense treaty with Japan**. Trump said the pact is too one-sided because it guarantees U.S. aid if Japan is ever attacked, but doesn't require Japan's military to do the same for America. The treaty was signed more than 60 years ago and it constitutes the foundation of the post-war alliance between the two countries after World War II.
