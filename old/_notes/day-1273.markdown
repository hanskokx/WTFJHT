1. **Trump called a press conference to announce new measures against China to punish it for its oppression of Hong Kong, but quickly turned the event into a campaign-style speech that went on for more than an hour.** Trump spoke from the Rose Garden, where he repeatedly drifted from topic to topic, rambling about China, trade, Joe Biden, military spending, the coronavirus pandemic, his friendship with Mexico's president, crime in Chicago, the death penalty, climate change, and more. At one point, he suggested that Biden would get rid of windows and "abolish the suburbs" if elected. At the end of the speech, he spent six minutes taking questions from reporters.

* **Trump again insisted that the U.S. would have fewer coronavirus cases if it reduced the amount of testing across the country.** "Think of this, if we didn’t do testing, instead of testing over 40 million people, if we did half the testing we would have half the cases,” Trump said at his Rose Garden press conference. "If we did another, you cut that in half, we would have, yet again, half of that. But the headlines are always testing."
