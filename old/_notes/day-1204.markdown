1. **More than half of the states that have started to reopen don't meet the criteria recommended by the White House for reopening business and resuming social activities**. The Trump administration's guidelines are nonbinding, but they recommend that states have a "downward trajectory" of either documented coronavirus cases or new positive test results. Most of the 30 states currently in the process of reopening not only fail to meet those basic criteria, but also have either upward trajectories for case counts, positive tests, or both. Most of the states are reopening with more new cases or a higher share of positive tests than two weeks ago. The guidelines also recommend that states should wait for a decline in the number of patients with coronavirus symptoms and a return to normal hospital capacities before reopening, standards which many states also fail to meet.

2. **A top Republican fundraiser and Trump campaign donor was picked to be the new head of the U.S. Postal Service**. Louis DeJoy currently runs a private logistics and distribution company in North Carolina. He was chosen by the Postal Service's Board of Governors to replace Postmaster General Megan Brennan, who was appointed in 2015 and is the first woman to hold the position. Since January, DeJoy has donated $360,000 to the Trump's re-election campaign and roughly $70,000 to the Republican National Committee.

3. **Trump vetoed legislation that would have limited the president's ability to wage war against Iran without Congressional approval.** Trump said he vetoed the Iran war powers resolution because he felt it was "insulting" to the presidency, calling it an "unnecessary and dangerous" prohibition. The legislation was first introduced in response to the U.S. assassination of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani. Trump said in a statement that the bill was "a very insulting resolution" which "implies that the Presidentâ€™s constitutional authority to use military force is limited to defense of the United States and its forces against imminent attack. That is incorrect." Congress is not expected to have the votes to override Trump's veto.
