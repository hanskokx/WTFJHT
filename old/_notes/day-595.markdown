1. **The Trump administration rejected an intelligence report last year that showed refugees do not post a significant security threat to the United States.** Hardliners inside the White House then issued their own report earlier this year that misstated the evidence and inflated the threat posed by those who were born outside the country.

2. **Trump said he would  be willing to shut down the government at the end of the month if Democrats don't provide enough funding for border security, reversing his position from the day before.** On Tuesday, Trump said, "I don’t see even myself or anybody else closing down the country right now." On Wednesday, Trump responded to a reporter's question about a government shutdown by saying, "If it happens, it happens. If it’s about border security, I’m willing to do anything. We have to protect our borders." Mitch McConnell said there was "no chance" of a government shutdown.

3. **Mike Pence and Mike Pompeo both strongly denied authoring the anonymous op-ed published yesterday in the New York Times.** "The Vice President puts his name on his Op-Eds," Pence's spokesperson said on Twitter. "It is sad that you have someone who would make that choice,” said Pompeo. "I come from a place where if you’re not in a position to execute the commander’s intent, you have a singular option, that is to leave." Social media speculation that Pence wrote the op-ed comes from the use of word "lodestar" in the piece, a word that Pence has used multiple times over the course of more than a decade.

4. **Brett Kavanaugh refused to answer a question about whether or not he had discussed Robert Mueller's investigation with one of Trump's attorneys.** Sen. Kamala Harris asked Kavanaugh whether he had spoken with anyone at Kasowitz Benson & Torres, warning Kavanaugh, "Be sure about your answer, sir." Kavanaugh dodged the question and responded: "Is there a person you’re talking about? I’m not sure I know everyone who works at that law firm. I’m not remembering \[any conversation.\]" When Harris pushed him to answer the question, Kavanaugh said, "Washington is full of law firms, law firms are full of people."

5. **A government photographer edited photos of Trump inauguration to make the crowd look bigger than it was after Trump personally intervened.** Newly released documents show that the photographer cropped out the empty space "where the crowd ended" after Trump requested a new set of pictures on the first morning of his presidency. The newly discovered details were not included in the inspector general office's final report on its inquiry into the situation.
