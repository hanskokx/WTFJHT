1. **All of the world leaders at the G20 Summit in Argentina — except for Trump — released a joint statement reaffirming their commitment to fighting climate change.** The U.S. did join a separate portion of the communique that focuses on energy and the role it plays in shaping the future of the planet.

2. **Trump and Putin had an "informal" meeting at the G20 Summit.** "As is typical at multilateral events," said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, "President Trump and the First Lady had a number of informal conversations with world leaders at the dinner last night, including President Putin." Trump previously canceled a formal meeting with Putin over Russia's recent seizure of Ukrainian ships and the detention of their crews. "I answered his questions about the incident in the Black Sea," said Putin. "He has his position. I have my own. We stayed in our own positions."

3. **James Comey has agreed to testify to Congress about the FBI's investigations during the 2016 campaign as long as lawmakers release the full transcript of his testimony within 24 hours.** Comey and his attorney filed a legal challenge last week to the Republican-led effort to compel him to testify. His attorney argued that the legal action was "to prevent the Joint Committee from using the pretext of a closed interview to peddle a distorted, partisan political narrative about the Clinton and Russian investigations through selective leaks." As part of the deal, Comey will be free to make all of part of his testimony available to the public.

4. **Michael Cohen was in "close and regular contact" with Trump's White House staff and legal team as he was preparing false statements for Congress about Trump's efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow during the 2016 campaign.** Cohen filed a motion in court seeking leniency in exchange for his cooperation, which says his false statement to Congress was based on Trump and his team's attempts to paint their interactions with Russian representatives "as having effectively terminated before the Iowa caucuses of February 1, 2016." Cohen's attorneys say he had a "lengthy substantive conversation with the personal assistant to a Kremlin official following his outreach in January 2016, engaged in additional communications concerning the project as late as June 2016, and kept \[Trump\] apprised of these communications."

5. **Rep. Adam Schiff, who leads the House Intelligence Committee, says Cohen's cooperation with Mueller's probe confirms that "the president and his business are compromised."** According to Schiff, "there is now testimony, there is now a witness, who confirms that in the same way Michael Flynn was compromised, that the president and his business are compromised." Cohen admitted to misleading investigators about the Trump Organization's efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. "\[W\]hat the president was saying," Schiff added, "what Michael Cohen was saying and others were saying about when this business deal ended was not true. And what's more, the Russians knew it wasn’t true." He continued: "It means that the president, whether he won or lost, was hoping to make money from Russia, was seeking at the same time to enlist the support of the Kremlin to make that money."
