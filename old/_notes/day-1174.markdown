1. **Trump has a personal financial interest in the company that makes the brand-name version of hydroxychloroquine**, the anti-malaria drug Trump has been touting as a "game changer" in the fight against the coronavirus. Trump and his family trusts are all invested in a mutual fund that features Sanofi as its largest holding. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and other associates of Trump also run funds that are invested in the pharmaceutical manufacturer. Trump has repeatedly ignored the advice of doctors and public health experts, who have warned him against promoting the drug due to the lack of evidence supporting its effectiveness.

2. **Trump's economic adviser warned White House officials in January that there was "an increasing probability of a full-blown COVID-19 pandemic that could infect as many as 100 million Americans, with a loss of life of as many as 1-2 million souls.**" In a pair of memos, Peter Navarro warned that the lack of a vaccine or cure for the virus "would leave Americans defenseless in the case of a full-blown coronavirus outbreak on U.S. soil." In a Jan. 29 memo, Navarro called called for "an immediate travel ban on China." In a second memo on Feb. 23, Navarro urged the Trump administration to immediately begin laying the groundwork for a $3 billion supplemental spending appropriation from Congress. "This is NOT a time for penny-pinching or horse trading on the Hill," the memo reads. Trump waited several weeks after receiving Navarro's memos before taking aggressive steps to mitigate the spread of the virus, and would later claim that "nobody could have predicted something like this."

3. **Sen. David Purdue bought stock in a company that makes personal protective equipment on the same day he received a classified Senate briefing on the spread of the virus in the U.S.** Purdue made a series of 112 transactions, 82 of which were made on March 3. Of those, 76 were purchases totaling up to $1.8 million and 34 were stock sales of up to $825,000.  A spokesperson for Purdue said he "has always had an outside adviser managing his personal finances, and he is not involved in day-to-day decisions" about his portfolio. Purdue is one of several lawmakers — including his fellow senator from Georgia, Kelly Loeffler, and Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina — who is facing questions about their trading activity in the wake of the outbreak.

4. **Top lawmakers and the White House are considering another financial assistance package to try and contain the economic impacts of the novel coronavirus pandemic.** House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congressional leaders are looking into a series of spending increases that would "easily" cost more than $1 trillion. Lawmakers are concerned that the $2.2 trillion aid package passed last month is not enough to prevent lasting damage to the U.S. economy. Trump has indicated that he would support some of the ideas floated by Democrats, including expanded help for small-business owners and new bailout checks for households. Republicans have called for additional corporate aid and more funding to boost the overwhelmed health-care system. The two sides still have several areas where they disagree, however, and it's unclear whether they'll be able to reach a deal in the coming weeks.
