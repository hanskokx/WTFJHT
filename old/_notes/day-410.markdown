1. **The State Department has spent $0 of the $120 million it has been allocated to combat foreign interference in U.S. elections.** At the department's Global Engagement Center, which is tasked with countering Moscow's disinformation campaigns, none of the 23 analysts speak Russian. And a hiring freeze has prevented the department from recruiting the kind of computer experts needed to track foreign efforts to meddle in the U.S. election process.

2. **Mueller's grand jury has issued a subpoena requesting all documents involving Trump and many of his associates**.

3. **Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats are preparing to repeal major banking regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis.** The new bill allows roughly two dozen financial firms with up to $250 billion in assets to avoid the highest levels of scrutiny from the Federal Reserve.

4. **Chris Christie suggested that Jared Kushner should resign.** "The situation is made much worse by the fact that we have family members in the White House," Christie told ABC News. Christie also said that it's "not just about Jared, but about any other members of his family having official positions."

5. **Trump commented on President Xi's recent consolidation of power in China and joked that he wouldn't mind doing the same for himself.** "He's now president for life. President for life. No, he's great," Trump said at a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago. Trump added: "And look, he was able to do that. I think it's great. Maybe we'll have to give that a shot some day."
