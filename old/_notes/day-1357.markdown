1. **Trump urged Congress to pass a new coronavirus stimulus package hours after ordering negotiators to stop talks with Democrats until after the election.** "If I am sent a Stand Alone Bill for Stimulus Checks ($1,200), they will go out to our great people IMMEDIATELY," Trump tweeted. "I am ready to sign right now. Are you listening Nancy?" Trump also called on Congress to "IMMEDIATELY" approve $25 billion for the airline industry and an additional $135 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program, adding, "I will sign now!"

2. **Senior White House adviser Stephen Miller tested positive for the coronavirus.** Miller said in a statement that he has been "working remotely and self-isolating, testing negative every day" over the last five days, but has since tested positive. Miller is the eleventh official to test positive after attending a White House event in the Rose Garden and the latest member of Trump's presidential debate prep team to test positive. Miller also traveled aboard Air Force One on a Minnesota campaign trip with Trump and Hicks.

3. **Top officials at the Justice Department were the main drivers behind the push to separate immigrant children from their families at the U.S.-Mexico border starting in 2018.** Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, deputy AG Rod Rosenstein, and others at the DOJ were "a driving force" behind Trump’s "zero tolerance" family separation policy, according to a two-year inquiry by the Justice Department’s inspector general. "We need to take away children," Sessions told the five U.S. attorneys along the border with Mexico in May 2018. Rosenstein went even further about a week later, telling the five prosecutors that it did not matter how young the children were. From the policy's earliest days, the report says, Justice Department officials understood — and encouraged — the separation of children as an expected part of the desire to prosecute all undocumented border crossers.

4. **Mike Pence agreed to have a plexiglass divider between himself and Kamala Harris at tonight's vice presidential debate.** Pence initially argued there was no need for a barrier on his side of the stage, but changed his mind after viewing the setup during a walk-through of the debate hall.
