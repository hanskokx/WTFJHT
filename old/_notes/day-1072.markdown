1. **Trump retweeted an article that contained the name of the alleged whistleblower at the center of Trump's impeachment**. Trump used his personal account to retweet his reelection account, the Trump War Room, which posted a link to a Washington Examiner story from Dec. 3 that names the alleged whistleblower in the headline. Several people close to Trump, including Ivanka and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, cautioned Trump against saying or posting the name in public.

2. **Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she is "disturbed" by the coordination between Mitch McConnell and the White House when it comes to the impeachment trial**. Murkowski said McConnell has "confused the process" by declaring that he is acting in "total coordination" with Trump to set the parameters of the trial. "To me," she continued, "it means that we have to take that step back from being hand in glove with the defense."

3. **The House Judiciary Committee said they could draft and recommend "new articles of impeachment" against Trump if new evidence is revealed by former White House Counsel Don McGahn**. Democrats have been trying for months to convince a judge to compel McGahn to testify as part of the impeachment proceedings against Trump, arguing that his testimony is "central" to parts of the investigation. Attorneys for the Committee argued that Trump's impeachment in the House has "reinforced" rather than undercut the need for the court to hear their case regarding McGahn's testimony.

4. **45 immigration judges have left their positions, moved into new roles in the immigration court system, or died over the last year â€” nearly double the number who departed their posts in 2017 and 2018**. The reasons for departure given by individual judges vary, but one theme unites them: frustration over policy changes that have limited their authority. Meanwhile, the Justice Department is currently facing a backlog of more than 1 million cases, pushing many immigration cases years into the future.
