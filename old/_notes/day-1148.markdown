1. **Trump banned all travel from Europe for the next 30 days in response to the growing COVID-19 pandemic.** The ban begins Friday at midnight. The restrictions do not apply to the United Kingdom or to U.S. citizens and they can be waived under multiple circumstances. During a public address from the Oval Office, Trump blamed European and Chinese people for bringing the outbreak to the United States and described the pandemic as a "foreign virus" and "a horrible infection." Trump read from a prepared script but incorrectly described his own policy, saying that the travel restrictions from Europe would apply to cargo and trade as well as passengers. Trump then urged Americans to heed the warnings of federal health experts, instructions he has contradicted or ignored on several occasions over the last few weeks.

2. **Trump's European travel restrictions exempt nations where his three golf courses are located.** Trump has two properties in the United Kingdom – Trump Turnberry and Trump International Golf Links in Scotland – plus another resort in Doonbeg, Ireland.

3. **The U.S. did not coordinate or notify the European Union before Trump announced his European travel ban**. "There was no heads-up, no coordination as the president claimed," a European diplomat. In a joint statement, the presidents of the European Commission and European Council said the EU "disapproves of the fact that the US decision to improve a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation."

4. **U.S. stock prices fell sharply in response to Trump's presidential address, triggering a "circuit breaker" that halted all NYSE trading for 15 minutes.** The S&P 500 fell by 7% shortly after the markets opened, while the Dow dropped by 1,100 points and Nasdaq futures were also deeply in the red.

5. **A Senate staffer tested positive for COVID-19.** Sen. Maria Cantwell's office announced Wednesday night that the staffer has been placed in isolation and that the office will be closed for the rest of the week to undergo a deep cleaning. The case marks the first known incident of a congressional staffer contracting the virus. ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/487162-senate-staffer-tests-positive-for-coronavirus))
