4. **The Senate passed a continuing resolution to fund the government and avoid another government shutdown until Dec. 20**. The bill passed with a 74-20 vote in the Senate after passing with a 231-192 vote in the House on Tuesday. The measure will now head to Trump's desk, where he is expected to sign it. The bill gives Congress a few weeks to pass a long-term spending bill in order to keep the government open. Government funding will lapse if Trump doesn't sign the bill by the end of the day on Friday.
