1. **The woman who founded the spa where Patriots owner Robert Kraft was caught soliciting prostitution from trafficked women arranged for Chinese business people to attend a Trump fundraiser.** Li Yang, who goes by Cindy, said she brought a large group of business people from China to a 2017 fundraiser as her guests. Yang personally gave $5,400 to Trump's campaign and $23,500 to the Trump Victory political action committee in the days leading up to the 2017 fundraiser.

2. **Yang also serves as an officer of two groups with ties to the Chinese government.** She founded a non-profit in Miami that promotes "economic and cultural exchange" between China and the U.S. in coordination with "senior…Chinese leaders" in the United States. Yang has been offering to sell access to the Trump family, the White House, and various GOP powerbrokers.

3. **New video footage from the Venezuelan border show that an anti-government protester set fire to a convoy of humanitarian aid last month, despite claims by Mike Pence and the State Department that President Nicolas Maduro had ordered the trucks burned.** The Colombian government released partial footage from the incident and attempted to blame Maduro, but newly released footage revealed that a member of the opposition threw a Molotov cocktail at the convoy, triggering the blaze.

4. **Trump told donors at a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago on Friday that "The Democrats hate Jewish people."** He said he didn't understand how anyone could vote for a Democrat, reminded the crowd of his decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, and speculated that he would be at 98% in the polls if he were to run to become the prime minister of Israel.

5. **House Intelligence chairman Adam Schiff said Erik Prince lied when he claimed during an interview last week that he testified about a 2016 meeting with foreign nationals at Trump Tower.** Prince is the former head of Blackwater, brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, and an informal adviser to the 2016 Trump campaign. He told Al Jazeera's Mehdi Hasan that he informed the House Intelligence Committee during his testimony in November 2017 about a meeting at Trump Tower with Trump Jr., UAE emissary George Nader, and Israeli social media manipulation specialist Joel Zamel — but none of that is in the transcript from his testimony.
