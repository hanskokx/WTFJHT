1. **Trump was in the room with Michael Cohen and National Enquirer publisher David Pecker when they discussed ways to combat negative stories about Trump's relationships with women.** The National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., admitted as part of a non-prosecution agreement that "Pecker offered to help deal with negative stories about that presidential candidate's relationships with women by, among other things, assisting the campaign in identifying such stories so they could be purchased and their publication avoided." AMI also admitted to making a payment of $150,000 "in concert with the campaign," and that Cohen and Pecker were in the room with "at least one other member of the campaign" during the meeting. The other member was Trump. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-was-room-during-hush-money-discussions-nbc-news-confirms-n947536))

2. **Michael Cohen told ABC News that Trump told him to make hush money payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal and "was very concerned about how this would affect the election."** Cohen admitted that he "knew what I was doing was wrong." He continued: "I stood up before the world \[Wednesday\] and I accepted the responsibility for my actions." When asked if Trump knew the payments were wrong, Cohen said, "Of course," and added that the whole purpose was to "help \[Trump\] and his campaign."
