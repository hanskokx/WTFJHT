1. **The House managed to pass the $19.1 billion disaster aid package after Republicans blocked the bill on three separate occasions.** The vote was 354-58. The measure now heads to Trump's desk, where he is expected to sign it. Once the bill is signed into law, the funding will be released and grants will be distributed to communities still recovering from hurricanes wildfires, tornadoes, floods, and other recent disasters.

2. **Congressional Republicans are discussing whether or not they may have to vote to block Trump's latest proposed tariffs against Mexico.** The vote would be the most dramatic defiance of Trump by the GOP since he took office, and could also block millions of dollars in funding for Trump's border wall, since Trump's plan to impose tariffs on Mexico relies on his national emergency declaration. Congress has the right to override the national emergency determination by passing a resolution of disapproval.

3. **Dozens of migrant children spent up to 39 hours in a van while waiting to be reunited with their parents.** What was supposed to be a 30-minute ride reunite with their parents at an ICE facility in Texas in July, turned into a two-night ordeal in the back of a van for the children, all of whom are between 5 and 12 years old. Most spent at least 23 hours in the vans. Emails between employees of the nonprofit government contractor responsible for transporting the children reveal frustrations with the lack of preparation by ICE and senior leadership at the Department of Health and Human Services.

4. **The owners of a luxury hotel in Panama City accused the Trump Organization of evading taxes in Panama and creating a "false light" around one of the hotel's finances.** The accusations were made in a legal filing in Manhattan federal court, and they essentially claim that Trump's family cheated a foreign government. They also claim that the Trump Organization "made fraudulent and false claims to the Panamanian tax authorities" in order to "cover up its unlawful activities," which was originally detected during an audit last year by that country's tax authority. The Trump Organization says the claims are "completely false." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/business/trump-panama-hotel-tax-evasion.html))
