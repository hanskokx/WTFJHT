1. **Nancy Pelosi unveiled a $2.5 trillion coronavirus aid package in the House after Republicans failed to pass their own version in the Senate.** The "Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act" would increase the amount of money being offered to individuals from $1,000 to $1,500, and up to $7,500 for a family of five. It also waives $10,000 in federal student loan payments, allocates $150 billion to support hospitals and medical facilities, eliminates cost-sharing for coronavirus treatments and vaccines, provides $500 billion in interest-free loans for small businesses, and much more. Discussions over the bills are expected to continue between McConnell, Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over the next few days.

2. **An Arizona man died after eating the chemical that Trump promoted as a possible cure for the coronavirus.** The man and his wife swallowed chloroquine phosphate, a common aquarium cleaner, shortly before being admitted to a hospital. The man died and the woman is currently in critical condition. Trump repeatedly suggested that the drug is a "game changer" when it comes to treating COVID-19, even while members of his own administration consistently contradicted his assertions. No drug has been proven to treat the virus and a vaccine could be months away.
