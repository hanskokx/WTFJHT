1. **Trump returned to the White House after leaving Walter Reed medical center.** Upon his arrival, Trump stood outside and removed his mask, despite the fact that he is still infected and contagious. He flashed a double thumbs up and posed for photos before walking inside as his helicopter departed. Shortly after, he released a video produced by his aides, in which he claimed that he "had to" face the coronavirus because he is a leader. "We're going back. We're going back to work. We're gonna be out front. As your leader I had to do that. I knew there's danger to it but I had to do it," Trump said. "I stood out front. I led. Nobody that's a leader would not do what I did. I know there's a risk there's a danger." He added: "And now I'm better, and maybe I'm immune? I don't know." Trump then encouraged Americans to "get out there" and to not let the virus "dominate your lives."

2. **The White House is not conducting contact tracing for guests and staff members who attended the Rose Garden party** where at least eight people, including Trump, are believed to have contracted COVID-19. Officials with the D.C. Department of Health have been unable to connect with the White House to assist with contact tracing and other protocols regarding the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Instead, the White House has only been notifying people who came in close contact with Trump during the two days before his diagnosis on Thursday. "We have reached out to the White House on a couple of different levels, a political level and a public health level," said Mayor Muriel Bowser. White House spokesman Brian Morgenstern said in a statement that the White House "has a robust contact tracing program in place led by the White House Medical Unit with CDC personnel and guidance."

3. **Top White House officials are blocking new federal guidelines for the emergency release of a coronavirus vaccine.** Officials are objecting to a strict new provision that would effectively guarantee that no vaccine could be authorized before the election on Nov. 3. The FDA is trying to find other ways to ensure that the vaccines meet the guidelines, including by sharing them with an outside advisory committee of experts in the hopes that the committee will enforce them even if the White House objects. Health experts are concerned that by refusing to allow the FDA to release the guidelines, the White House is undercutting the governmentâ€™s effort to reassure the public that any vaccine will be safe and effective.

4. **Eric Trump was deposed under oath as part of New York's investigation into the Trump Organization's financial dealings.** The New York attorney general's office is probing whether Trump's real-estate company falsely reported property values in order to obtain loans or tax benefits. Eric initially refused to provide testimony until after the November election, but a state judge rejected his argument that he was too busy working on his father's re-election campaign to submit to questioning. New York AG Letitia James is focusing on a property called Seven Springs that sits on 212 acres outside New York City, as well as transactions involving the Trump-owned 40 Wall Street building in lower Manhattan, a golf club in Los Angeles, and the Trump International Hotel and Tower Chicago. The Trump Organization has denied any wrongdoing.
