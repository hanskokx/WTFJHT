1. **More than 6.6 million people filed first-time unemployment claims last week — marking the largest and fastest string of job losses since 1948.** Roughly 16.8 million total new claims have been filed over the last three weeks, or about 10% of the U.S. workforce. This week's jobless claims went down by 261,000 from last week, which saw nearly 6.9 people apply for unemployment. California, New York, and Michigan had the largest increases in claims last week.

2. **The Federal Reserve plans to inject an additional $2.3 trillion into the U.S. economy in order to mitigate the financial impacts of the coronavirus pandemic.** The new plan would provide loans to business with up to 10,000 employees and less than $2.5 billion in annual revenue in 2019. Principal and interest payments would be deferred for one year. The $2.3 trillion would also include a $500 billion lending program for small businesses and municipal governments, which would begin at $1 million and would be capped at either $25 million or at an amount that "when added to the Eligible Borrower’s existing outstanding and committed but undrawn debt, does not exceed four times the Eligible Borrower’s 2019 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization."

3. **Trump is preparing to unveil a second coronavirus task force.** The group would deal specifically with the economic impacts of the virus while working toward the reopening of the U.S. economy. Membership on the task force would include a mix of representatives from the private sector and top Trump administration officials, including Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, and economic adviser Larry Kudlow. The economic task force would be separate from the main coronavirus task force, led by Pence, and would focus on getting as much of the U.S. economy as possible up and running again by April 30. An official announcement is expected as early as week.

4. **The U.S. ambassador to South Korea plans to resign after the 2020 election.** Harry Harris has said privately that he plans to leave his post, regardless of who wins in November, citing his increasing frustration with the tensions and drama he experienced as the public face of Trump's "America First" policies in South Korea.
