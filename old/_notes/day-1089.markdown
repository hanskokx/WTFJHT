1. **Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he never saw any specific evidence that Iran was planning attacks against four U.S. embassies**, which Trump previously cited as the reason the U.S. needed to assassinate Qasem Soleimani. "We will tell you probably it was going to be the embassy in Baghdad," Trump told Fox News in the wake of Soleimani's killing. "I can reveal that I believe it would have been four embassies." But over the weekend, Esper contradicted Trump and claimed that he only meant there "probably could be" additional attacks against U.S. embassies, and that Trump "didnâ€™t cite a specific piece of evidence" to backup his claim. Esper also admitted that he sent "thousands of American paratroopers to the Middle East to reinforce our embassy in Baghdad and other sites" based on Trump's evidence-free assertion.

* **Trump authorized the assassination of Qasem Soleimani seven months ago**, as long as certain conditions were met. Trump issued a presidential directive in June that the killing of Soleimani was "only on the table if they hit Americans," referring to Iranian actions in the region. The directive also came with the condition that Trump would have the final say on any specific operation to kill the Iranian general.

1. **The Department of Homeland Security placed a group of non-violent climate activists on a list of "extremists" alongside white supremacists and mass killers**, according to newly obtained documents. Members of Climate Direct Action, nicknamed the Valve Turners, are known for acts of civil disobedience like closing the valves on oil pipelines in four states. DHS described the group as "suspected environmental rights extremists" and listed them alongside people like Dylann Roof, who killed nine black churchgoers during a 2015 racist attack in Charleston, SC.

2. **The official White House Twitter account tweeted a picture of snow falling around the White House with the caption, "First snow of the year!" even though it was around 70 degrees in Washington, DC that day**. The photo in the tweet was actually taken on Jan. 7, the last time it snowed in DC.
