1. **The city of Tulsa, OK is experiencing a surge in coronavirus cases roughly two weeks after Trump held a rally at an indoor arena in the city.** The city has confirmed more than 500 new cases in two days and trends are showing that the increases will continue. Before the rally, there had been a 20% decline in new cases. The director of the Tulsa Health Department said at a news conference that it was reasonable to link the spike to the rally and related events. He added that the city has "had some significant events in the past few weeks that more than likely contributed" to the spike, and said he expects to see "an exponential rise in cases" over the next few days.

2. **A group of attorneys in Jacksonville, FL filed a lawsuit to prevent the GOP from holding the Republican National Convention in the city next month.** The suit claims holding the convention amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic would be "a nuisance injurious to the health \[and\] welfare" of the city. The suit was filed days after Florida set new records for the most confirmed COVID-19 cases in one state in a single day â€” more than 11,400 cases on Saturday. The plaintiffs are requesting that the VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena admit no more than 2,500 people and leave the rest of the 15,000 seats in the arena "isolated or roped off" to ensure social distancing.

3. **Former U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman will testify today before the House Judiciary Committee after he was fired last month by Attorney General William Barr.** Berman will testify behind closed doors to discuss his dismissal as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, which was in the process of investigating several Trump associates at the time Berman was fired. Democrats claim Berman's firing represents an unprecedented politicization of the DOJ by Barr and Trump. Barr is scheduled to testify publicly before the Judiciary Committee later this month.
