1. **Trump unveiled his 2020 campaign machine, which rolls his own campaign and the Republican National Committee into a single entity.** The structure of the new organization calls for the merging of Trump's reelection campaign and the RNC, with the field and fundraising programs operating under the banner of "Trump Victory." The two teams will also share office space. The goal of the merger is to create a single, streamlined organization that can adapt quickly and save resources, while also minimizing staff overlap and infighting.

2. **Michael Flynn is scheduled to be sentenced today for lying to federal investigators about his conversations in 2016 with Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition.** Flynn cooperated with Robert Mueller's team in exchange for a recommendation from Mueller's office that he serve a lighter sentence in his criminal case. He faces up to six months in prison, but Mueller recommended that he serve no jail time for his crimes because of the "substantial help" he provided to the special counsel and other investigators in multiple criminal inquiries.

3. **Robert Mueller released a memo from 2017 that summarizes Michael Flynn's contemporaneous interview with the FBI.** The interview was the catalyst that led to the high-profile case against Trump's former national security adviser and felon. According to the memo, Flynn lied during the interview about his contact with then-Russian ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak during the 2016 presidential transition period. The memo includes clear examples of Flynn lying and claiming that he never made any policy requests of Russia as FBI agents prod him to provide fuller descriptions of his calls.

4. **Trump wished Michael Flynn "good luck" as Flynn heads to court for his sentencing hearing today.** "Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn," Trump tweeted. "Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign." Trump added: "There was no Collusion!" Flynn will be the highest-ranking Trump administration aide to be sentenced (yet) as part of Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

5. **Giuliani says Trump's attorneys are negotiating with Mueller's team over whether or not to provide more written answers to Mueller's questions.** "We might agree," Giuliani said. If they do agree, he continued, Trump might provide "a few more answers. ... Or we might not."

6. **The Russian disinformation campaign also targeted Robert Mueller** by falsely claiming that he was corrupt and that the claims of Russian interference in the 2016 election were mere conspiracy theories. Russian operatives went after Mueller and his team via fake social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms. They also claimed that Mueller had a history of working with "radical Islamic groups."

7. **Roger Stone admitted to spreading lies via InfoWars and will be required to make a public apology in order to avoid paying the fines in the now-settled defamation lawsuit against him.** Stone will be forced to run apology ads in national newspapers and post on   social media apologizing for defaming a Chinese businessman who is a vocal critic of Beijing. The settlement also requires Stone to publish a retraction of all the lies he posted on social media. If Stone refuses to apologize, he will be forced to pay $100 million in damages to Guo Wengui. In a text message, Stone said his behavior was "irresponsible" and said that "I am solely responsible for fulfilling the terms of the settlement."

8. **The Trump administration announced a second and final round of roughly $4.9 billion in direct trade aide payments to farmers and ranchers who have been hurt by Trump's trade wars with various countries around the globe, including China.** The effort is the latest attempt by Trump to ease the burden placed on U.S. farmers and ranchers who have been hurt by retaliatory tariffs as a result of Trump's trade ongoing disputes. "Today," Trump tweeted, "I am making good on my promise to defend our Farmers & Ranchers from unjustified trade retaliation by foreign nations." He continued: "I have authorized Secretary \[Sonny\] Perdue to implement the 2nd round of Market Facilitation Payments. Our economy is stronger than ever â€” we stand with our Farmers!" The latest round of payments brings the total direct payment spending to nearly $9.6 billion. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/17/trump-farmers-trade-relief-usda-1067716))
