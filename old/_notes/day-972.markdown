1. **The Trump administration is considering options for attacking Iran**. Trump is reportedly weighing a range of options for taking action against Iran, including a cyber attack or physical strike on Iranian oil facilities, using the recent drone strikes on Saudi Arabian oil facilities as the justification. One option includes a strike by Saudi Arabia, which the U.S. would support by providing intelligence, targeting information, and surveillance capabilities, but the U.S. would refrain from actually firing any weapons at Iran. Other options include strikes on missile launch sites, bases, or other assets of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. There are currently no indications that any U.S. military action is imminent.

2. **The White House fired the general counsel for the Department of Homeland Security**. One official said John Mitnick will be replaced by Chad Mizelle, an associate counsel to the president, but another official said later that the principal deputy general counsel at DHS, Joseph Maher, would replace Mitnick. The White House made it clear back in April that Mitnick and the head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services would soon be ousted. Mitnick was fired in part due to his office's opposition to Stephen Miller and Miller's immigration policies.

1. **The Trump administration proposed a new rule that would allow pork plants to use fewer line inspectors from the Department of Agriculture and to run slaughter lines without any speed limit**. The rule allows factory workers, instead of USDA inspectors, to remove unsuitable carcasses and trim defects in plants that are subject to the new inspection system. USDA inspectors will still examine the carcasses, but they will be stationed farther down the lines. The new rule is intended to modernize an antiquated inspection system, but consumer advocates say it will make food less safe and increase the risks to workers.

2. **Mike Pence canceled a trip to meet with the leader of the Solomon Islands after the island government cut ties with Taiwan and switched its allegiance to China**. The meeting was supposed to be an opportunity for the U.S. to discuss development partnerships with the Solomon Islands, and it was supposed to take place on the sidelines of or shortly after the upcoming U.N. General Assembly meeting. The Solomon Islands is the sixth country to switch its allegiance from Taiwan to China since 2016.
