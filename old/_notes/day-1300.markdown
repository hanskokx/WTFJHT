1. **Trump was abruptly evacuated from a press briefing after a man who claimed he had a weapon was shot by a U.S. Secret Service officer just outside the White House**. The unidentified 51-year-old man was shot near the White House fence after he approached a Secret Service officer, told him he had a weapon, ran toward the officer, and pulled an object from his clothing, according to the Secret Service. The agency did not answer questions about whether the man actually had a gun, or if the officer was injured. The man and the officer were taken to George Washington University Hospital. The White House briefing room was placed on lockdown immediately after Trump was evacuated. Trump later returned to the briefing room and continued talking to reporters.

2. **Trump claimed that in 1917 the Spanish Flu "probably ended the Second World War," even though that pandemic began in 1918 and World War II didn't begin until 1939.** "The closest thing is in 1917, they say, the great pandemic," Trump said, comparing the Spanish Flu to COVID-19. "It certainly was a terrible thing where they lost anywhere from 50 to 100 million people, probably ended the Second World War." He added: "All the soldiers were sick. That was a terrible situation." A White House official claimed Trump was talking about World War I, where more soldiers died from the disease than from fighting.

3. **Trump also claimed during a press conference that he would not have called on Obama to resign from office if 160,000 Americans had died under his administration's watch**. Trump, however, tweeted in 2014 that Obama should resign for allowing a single doctor who tested positive for Ebola to enter the U.S. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/trump-obama-resign-787b042d-0361-48f1-bba5-c97b05837331.html))

4. **The House will not hold any floor votes until Sept. 14 unless a deal on a coronavirus stimulus package is reached.** House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer announced that members will remain on 24-hour notice to return to Washington in case a deal is reached. Democrats and the White House have not met since negotiations broke down without a deal on Friday. Congress is also under pressure to pass a deal on government funding before it expires on Sept. 30, potentially leading to a government shutdown.
