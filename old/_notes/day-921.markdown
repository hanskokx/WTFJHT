1. **More than 100 Democrats in the House have called for impeachment proceedings against Trump to begin**. A total of 104 House Democrats have publicly supported the move, including 12 since Mueller's testimony last week. Rep. Justin Amash, who recently left the Republican Party and became an independent, has also called for impeachment. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said Trump "richly deserves impeachment," but said it was too soon to begin the process. "He has done many impeachable offenses," Nadler said. "He's violated the law six ways from Sunday. But that's not the question. The question is, can we develop enough evidence to put before the American people? We have broken the logjam."

2. **Trump announced on Sunday that Dan Coates will step down as director of national intelligence**. In his place, Trump nominated one of his most ardent defenders, Texas Rep. John Ratcliffe, to take over the nation's vast network of spy agencies. Coates will officially leave his post on Aug. 15. If confirmed by the Senate, Ratcliffe will present different perspective than Coates, who frequently pushed back against Trump on foreign policy issues like Russia and North Korea. Trump also reportedly enjoyed watching Ratcliffe grill Robert Mueller during last week's hearings.

3. **Trump lashed out at Baltimore over the weekend and called Maryland's largest city "a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess," which he blamed on Rep. Elijah Cummings.** Trump also called Cummings, a black civil rights icon, "racist."  Trump said "no human being would want to live there" and called Baltimore a "very dangerous & filthy place." Cummings, along with the Baltimore Sun editorial team and the leaders of several other large cities, many of whom Trump has also denigrated, came out publicly against Trump's remarks and in defense of Baltimore. Trump's twitter rant appeared to be in response to a Fox News segment he watched earlier that morning, which included images of rundown and neglected apartment buildings. Jared Kushner, meanwhile, owns more than a dozen apartment complexes in the area that have been cited for hundreds of code violations and, critics say, provide substandard housing to lower-income tenants.
