1. **Trump was fully aware of the efforts to pressure Ukraine to dig up damaging information about the Bidens on his behalf**, according to Lev Parnas. Parnas said in an interview that he regularly communicated with top Republican fundraisers regarding his efforts. While he never spoke with Trump directly about his efforts, Parnas met with Trump on several occasions and was told by Giuliani that Trump was kept informed about his work. "I am betting my whole life," Parnas said, "that Trump knew exactly everything that was going on that Rudy Giuliani was doing in Ukraine." Parnas also said Attorney General William Barr "had to have known everything" that was going on with Ukraine, and that "Barr was basically on the team."

2. **Trump threatened to withhold more than just military aid from Ukraine** if President Zelesnky refused to announce investigations into the Bidens. "The message was: It wasn’t just military aid," Parnas said. "It was all aid." Parnas said he delivered that "harsh message" to Ukraine on behalf of Giuliani and Trump. He also said that Trump's efforts in Ukraine were "never about corruption," they were "strictly about Burisma, which included Hunter Biden and Joe Biden."

1. **Democrats released more evidence obtained from Parnas, including voicemails, photos, and text messages between him and high-level Trump associates**. The previously undisclosed documents were released Tuesday night but initially went unnoticed. They were posted just before the House formally sent its articles of impeachment against Trump to the Senate. Democrats have been trying to introduce as much new information into the investigative record as possible so it can be included and used during the Senate impeachment trial, which is expected to formally begin today.

2. **A part of the 2017 Trump tax cuts is being investigated by the Treasury Department**. The Opportunity Zone tax break was meant to help poor communities by encouraging investment in new housing, businesses, and jobs — but it quickly became a windfall for wealthy investors. Money that was eligible for the tax break was instead being used to fund luxury development projects in wealthy neighborhoods, including projects by friends of Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and members of the Kushner family.
