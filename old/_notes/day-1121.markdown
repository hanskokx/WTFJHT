1. **Trump admitted that he ordered Rudy Giuliani to go to Ukraine to dig up damaging information about his political opponents** after vehemently denying it during his impeachment inquiry. When asked during Geraldo Rivera's podcast if he was sorry that he sent Giuliani to Ukraine, Trump said, "No, not at all." He continued: "Here's my choice: I deal with the Comeys of the world, or I deal with Rudy." Trump went on to defend his decision by claiming that Giuliani is a "crime fighter" and that "other presidents had \[lawyers\]."

2. **The Justice Department announced it will not charge former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe with lying to investigators.** The DOJ's letter to McCabe's attorney ends a months-long inquiry stemming from inaccurate statements McCabe made to FBI investigators about his actions around the time of the 2016 election. The White House was not given advance notice about the decision, which upset Trump. A White House official said Trump "believes very strongly that action should be taken."

3. **Trump will be the guest of honor at a fundraiser at the estate of billionaire Nelson Peltz that costs $580,600 per couple to attend**. The fundraiser on Saturday just a miles from Mar-a-Lago will be the most expensive one since Trump took office. Trump has attended at least 48 gatherings with elite Republican donors since October 2017.

4. **Mitch McConnell says he would fill a Supreme Court vacancy if it opened up before the November election**, despite doing the opposite near the end of the Obama presidency when Antonin Scalia died. In 2016, McConnell refused to hold confirmation hearings or a vote on Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland. McConnell later called the move the "most consequential thing" he's ever done and one of the proudest moments of his political career.

5. **Former Trump body man John McEntee will return to the White House to lead the Presidential Personnel Office**. McEntee was previously fired by then-White House chief of staff John Kelly over issues with his security clearance. Trump is concerned about federal government employees who he thinks are "never-Trumpers," but he sees McEntee as a die-hard loyalist who will now be in charge of choosing personnel across multiple departments.
