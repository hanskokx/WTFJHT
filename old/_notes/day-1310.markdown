1. **Trump asked the Supreme Court to let him block critics from his personal Twitter account.** The administration wrote in a court filing that Trump's @RealDonaldTrump account is his personal property and that using it to block people is akin to elected officials who refuse to allow their opponents' yard signs on their front lawns. "President Trump's ability to use the features of his personal Twitter account, including the blocking function, are independent of his presidential office," acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall wrote. The federal appeals court in New York ruled last year that Trump's use of the account is overwhelmingly official in nature and that blocking people to silence a viewpoint amounts to a violation of the First Amendment. A decision about whether even to hear the case is not likely before the November election.

2. **Trump said he would send sheriffs, law enforcement, and U.S. attorneys to polling locations to guard against voter fraud on Election Day.** "We're going to have sheriffs, and we're going to have law enforcement, and we're going to have, hopefully, US attorneys, and we're going to have everybody and attorney generals \[sic\]," Trump said during a Fox News interview. It is not clear that Trump has the authority to do that. An election law expert said Trump has no authority to deploy local law enforcement officials to monitor elections, but his campaign could hire off-duty police to work the polls. Any attempt to do so would likely draw legal challenges from Democrats, who would argue that the move amounted to attempted voter suppression.

3. **The Trump re-election effort has spent more than $1 billion since 2017 to ensure Trump remains in office for another four years**. The record-breaking sum is the combined effort of the Trump campaign, the Republican Party, and two affiliated committees. The DNC, by comparison, has spent roughly $643 million so far, according to federal records. Trumpâ€™s reelection effort raised $165 million in July, compared to Biden and the DNC's $140 million. Trump reported entering August with more than $300 million cash on hand, and Biden reported about $294 million.

4. **Steve Bannon pleaded not guilty after being indicted and taken into custody in New York on federal fraud charges.** A federal judge agreed to release the former Trump administration chief strategist on a $5 million bond. Bannon's travel will be restricted to New York and Washington D.C., and he is prohibited from using private jets or boats without prior approval. Bannon and three other men are charged with defrauding donors out of hundreds of thousands of dollars for their own profit via a crowdfunding campaign called "We Build the Wall," which raised more than $25 million. Bannon's co-conspirators are Brian Kolfage, who served as the organization's founder and president, Andrew Badolato and Timothy Shea.
