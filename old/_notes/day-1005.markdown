1. **Trump decided not to host next year's G7 summit at his Trump National Doral Resort**. Instead, Trump said his administration "will begin the search for another site, including the possibility of Camp David, immediately." Trump was forced to abandon his plan to host the summit at his private golf club after it became clear that the decision had alienated Republicans and become part of the impeachment inquiry. During calls with conservative allies over the weekend, Trump was told that Republicans are struggling to continue defending him on so many fronts.

2. **Sen. Lindsey Graham said he could not rule out the possibility of impeaching Trump if new evidence emerges that Trump has committed a crime**. Graham was asked whether he would be more open to impeachment if more evidence comes out, to which he replied: "Sure, I mean show me something that is a crime." He continued, referring to Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Zelensky: "If you could show me that, you know, Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo outside the phone call, that would be very disturbing." Still, Graham said he doesn't view Trump's call with Zelensky as evidence of a quid pro quo in and of itself. "I've read the transcript of the Ukrainian phone call," he said. "That's not a quid pro quo to me."

3. **The Justice Department confirmed that Trump Jr. and former White House counsel Don McGahn were never called to testify in front of a grand jury as part of Robert Mueller's investigation**. Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. said it was perplexing why Trump Jr. and McGahn were never subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury. "The reason is not that the individuals were insignificant to the investigation," Judge Howell wrote, "To the contrary, both of the non-testifying individuals named in paragraph four figured in key events examined in the Mueller Report."

4. **The Justice Department issued a statement declaring that DOJ officials would not have met with Giuliani to discuss one of his clients had they known that federal prosecutors in New York were investigating two of his associates**. Lawyers from the DOJ's Criminal Division and Fraud Section met with Giuliani several weeks ago to discuss a bribery case in which Giuliani and others were representing the defendants. The meeting occurred before prosecutors in Manhattan publicly charged Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman with violating campaign finance laws to unlawfully influence politicians. "When Mr. Benczkowski and fraud section lawyers met with Mr. Giuliani," said a DOJ spokesperson, "they were not aware of any investigation of Mr. Giulianiâ€™s associates in the Southern District of New York and would not have met with him had they known."
