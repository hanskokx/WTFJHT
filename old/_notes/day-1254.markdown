1. **The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to strike down the Affordable Care Act, even as the U.S. death toll from the coronavirus tops more than 120,000 Americans.** The brief submitted to the court asks the justices to invalidate the entire law on the basis that the individual mandate is unconstitutional. Solicitor General Noel Francisco said in a court filing that once the ACA's individual coverage mandate and two other key provisions are invalidated, "the remainder of the ACA should not be allowed to remain in effect." If the court agrees, the more than 25 million Americans who are currently out of work, including those who are unemployed due to the pandemic, would be unable to access the expanded Medicaid services or the marketplaces that offer health insurance with consumer protections. The White House has not put forward a program to replace the ACA if the court decides to strike it down.
