1. **A landmark scientific report issued by 13 federal agencies includes the most drastic and specific warnings to date of the consequences of climate change for the United States.** Among other things, [the report](https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/) predicts that the effects of global warming will eliminate as much as 10%  of the U.S. economy by the end of the century. The report's findings and calculations are blunt and precise. They're also directly at odds with the Trump administration's environmental deregulation agenda, which Trump claims will lead to economic growth. The report's predictions include devastating effects on the U.S. economy, health, and environment, including record wildfires in California, widespread Midwestern crop failures, and crumbling infrastructure in the South. The report adds to the conclusions of an earlier iteration, which also warned of increasing water scarcity in dry areas, torrential downpours in wet regions, and increasingly severe heat waves and wildfires throughout.

2. **A Manhattan judge refused Trump's bid to throw out a lawsuit that alleges he used the Trump Foundation for his own personal and political purposes.** The suit alleges that Trump, along with Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr., engaged in "extensive unlawful political coordination with the Trump presidential campaign, repeated and willful self-dealing transactions to benefit Mr. Trump's personal and business interests, and violations of basic legal obligations for nonprofit foundations." A lawyer for the Trump Foundation tried to have the case thrown out because, according to court filings, he does not believe that a sitting president can be sued. He also argued that Trump family didn't knowingly do anything wrong, and claimed the suit was an act of political bias.

3. **The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to hear a case challenging Trump's policy that bans transgender people from serving in the military.** The move is an aggressive attempt by the Trump administration to bypass federal appeals courts and bring the case directly to the high court for a decision. District courts across the country have so far prevented the policy from going into effect, and the DC Circuit is scheduled to hear arguments in early December.

4. **The White House deputy communications chief has and will continue to receive $8.4 million in severance payments from Fox News over the next two years.** Bill Shine's financial disclosure form shows he will also receive a bonus and stock options package worth about $3.5 this year and again in 2019. Shine was accused in multiple lawsuits of enabling and helping to cover up alleged sexual harassment by Fox News executives. The form confirms that Shine will now be paid by both Fox News and the White House at the same time.

5. **The Trump administration has increased the number of drone strikes in Yemen, Somalia, and Pakistan since taking office.** Obama launched 186 drone strikes in those three countries during his first two years in office, while Trump launched 238 in 2017 and 2018. Once in office, Trump relaxed the burden of proof requirements for targets put in place by the Obama administration, which counterterrorism experts say helps explain the increase in strikes. The change in policy also accompanied a massive spike in drone strikes in 2017. ([Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-ramped-up-drone-strikes-in-americas-shadow-wars))
