1. **A federal judge ordered the 2020 Census to continue for another month through the end of October.** U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in California stopped the Census from finishing at the end of September, saying a shortened schedule likely would produce inaccurate results. The Census conducted once every ten years, and is used to determine the distribution of $1.5 trillion in federal spending each and the number of congressional seats each state receives. Koh’s preliminary injunction also suspends the Dec. 31 deadline for the final count. Civil rights groups and local governments alleged that the decision to shorten the schedule was made to accommodate a directive from Trump, who tried to exclude undocumented immigrants from the count. A three-judge panel in New York blocked Trump’s directive earlier this month, which the Trump administration is appealing to the Supreme Court.

2. **Virginia officials are seeking to stop Trump from holding a rally in Richmond tonight.** Dr. Natasha Dwamena, a Department of Public Health district director, warned of a "severe public health threat" if the planned campaign rally is allowed to take place at the Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport. Roughly 4,000 people are expected to attend the event, despite Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's order banning gatherings of more than 250 people. Dwamena said the rally should be canceled, rescheduled, or scaled down to comply with the governor’s order. Northam's top health and transportation aides also sent letters Thursday to airport officials around the state reminding them that they have "the authority to enforce" the state's laws.

3. **More than 28 million ballots have been requested, with another 42 million scheduled to be automatically mailed out to voters across the country.** The total number of pre-election ballots due to be distributed already exceeds the roughly 50 million pre-Election Day ballots cast in 2016. Requests from registered Democrats outpace those from Republicans by more than 1.3 million ballot requests. Nationally, more than half a million ballots have already been cast in the 12 states reporting. Roughly two dozen states have now started absentee voting or in-person early voting.

4. **Postmaster General Louis DeJoy told a judge that that USPS can't reassemble the hundreds of high speed mail-sorting machines that were taken apart this year because they've already been stripped for parts.** DeJoy also asked that a nationwide injunction issued last week should be amended to acknowledge that the machines can't be put back together because they were dismantled and are being used to repair other machines. "It is therefore not possible to return such machines to service," DeJoy and the USPS said in a court filing. U.S. District Judge Stanley A. Bastian has yet to rule on DeJoy’s request to amend the injunction. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-24/dejoy-tells-judge-mail-sorting-machines-can-t-be-reassembled))
