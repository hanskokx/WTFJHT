1. **The Trump administration released a trove of heavily redacted documents that contain the first communications between government agencies when the military aid to Ukraine was withheld earlier this year**. The documents include email conversations between the deputy comptroller at the Department of Defense and White House Office of Management and Budget staff, as well as spreadsheets of financial figures that appear to be related to Ukraine. The documents are so heavily redacted that most of the details about the conversations and exchanges remain unclear.

2. **More than $20 million of the military aid that was supposed to go to Ukraine still hasn't reached that country**. $20.2 million of the Pentagonâ€™s $250-million portion of the aid is still sitting in U.S. accounts, undermining one of the key GOP arguments against impeachment: that Ukraine eventually received the aid despite the hold placed on it by the Trump administration. Letters from lawmakers to Defense Secretary Mark Esper and other officials asking about the continued delay have gone unanswered.

3. **Mitch McConnell said there's "no chance" that Trump will be removed from office as a result of the impeachment trial in the Senate**. McConnell also said it "wouldn't surprise" him if some Democrats even broke ranks to vote in favor of Trump. "The case is so darn weak coming from the House," McConnell said during an interview on Fox News. "We know how it's going to end." McConnell and the White House have agreed to coordinate their plans for the impeachment trial, which McConnell has said he will end as soon as he has 51 GOP votes in place for a final vote.
