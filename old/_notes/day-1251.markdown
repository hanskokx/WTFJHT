1. **Trump banned several categories of foreign workers and issued new restrictions on immigration visas until the end of the year.** The measure expands previous restrictions by adding more work visas to the ban list, including software engineers and other skilled workers who enter the country under the H-1B visa, seasonal workers in the hospitality industry, students on work-study summer programs, and au pairs who arrive under other auspices. It doesn't not affect workers who are already in the country. Trump cited the coronavirus pandemic as the justification for the expanded ban, but critics say the Trump administration is using the global health crisis as cover to enact the kinds of border closures and immigration changes he has always pushed for. Major U.S. tech companies and other businesses also condemned the move. According to the Trump administration's own estimates, the new restrictions will prevent foreign workers from filling 525,000 jobs in the U.S. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/trump-immigration-workers-coronavirus/2020/06/22/3b969e88-b489-11ea-9b0f-c797548c1154_story.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/politics/trump-h1b-work-visas.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/tech-firms-blast-trumps-extended-h-1b-visa-restrictions-051d9158-3734-4dca-9124-37bf3914e1d4.html))

2. **The House Judiciary Committee is preparing to subpoena Attorney General William Barr to testify about the firing of U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman.** Chairman Jerry Nadler wants Barr to appear on July 2 to explain why Berman was fired. Berman had been investigating Rudy Giuliani and other Trump associates at time of his firing. Nadler has also asked Berman to testify, but it is unclear if Berman will do so. Nadler has called on Barr several times in recent weeks to testify before the committee about the Justice Department's handling of the criminal cases involving former Trump advisers, including Roger Stone and Michael Flynn. Nadler and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi discussed the idea over the weekend and decided "to be ready" to subpoena Barr if he refuses to appear in front of the committee.

3. **The White House admitted that Trump was involved Geoffrey Berman's firing after Trump initially claimed over the weekend that he was "not involved" in the process.** White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump was "involved in the sign-off capacity," describing Berman's removal as a simple swap that would allow SEC chairman Jay Clayton to take over the job. Clayton has never been a litigator or prosecutor but has expressed interest in the position at the Southern District of New York, but McEnany was unable to explain why Berman was dismissed before Clayton was confirmed by the Senate. "The hope is Clayton will be confirmed," she said. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/22/politics/trump-us-attorney-fired/index.html))

4. **A confrontation between U.S. Park Police and protesters in Lafayette Park led the U.S. Secret Service to issue an unusual order that members of the White House press corps immediately leave the premises.** Protesters attempted to topple a statue of former President Andrew Jackson in the park, but they were hit with pepper spray and pushed back by police. Later, the Secret Service issued a statement that said "four members of the media were misdirected" to leave the White House grounds after the clash between police and protesters.

5. **Trump threatened anyone involved in tearing down statues in the U.S. with up to 10 years in prison.** Trump also suggested that the penalties could be applied "retroactively" to anyone who damaged or pulled down monuments in recent weeks. "I have authorized the Federal Government to arrest anyone who vandalizes or destroys any monument, statue or other such Federal property in the US with up to 10 years in prison," Trump tweeted, citing the Veteranâ€™s Memorial Preservation Act, "or such other laws that may be pertinent." He added: "This action is taken effective immediately, but may also be used retroactively for destruction or vandalism already caused. There will be no exceptions!"
