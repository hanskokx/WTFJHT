2. **A report from the Justice Department Inspector General found evidence that an FBI employee may have altered a surveillance document related to the Russia investigation**. The document was part of an application for surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. The employee was a low-level FBI attorney who has since been forced out of the agency after the alteration was discovered. The allegation is part of Inspector General Michael Horowitz's forthcoming report on the origins of the Mueller investigation, which has yet to be released publicly. The report concluded that the altered document did not impact the overall validity of the surveillance application.
