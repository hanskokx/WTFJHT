1. **The Pentagon spent money that was meant to build up the country's supplies of medical equipment on defense contracts for military equipment such as jet engine parts, body armor and dress uniforms.** The Cares Act gave the Pentagon $1 billion to "prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus," but a few weeks later the Defense Department changed the way it would award the money and who it would go to. Instead of paying for masks and other medical supplies, the money was instead diverted toward patching up long-standing perceived gaps in military supplies. The money was mostly funneled to defense contractors, some of which were given the Pentagon funding even though they had already dipped into the Paycheck Protection Program.

2. **The Manhattan district attorney suggested in a court filing for the first time that it has grounds to investigate Trump and his businesses for tax fraud.** Cyrus Vance's office submitted a court filing as part of a yearlong legal battle for Trump's tax returns that doesn't directly accuse Trump or any of his business of wrongdoing, but includes reports that prosecutors say would justify a grand jury inquiry into possible tax and insurance fraud and falsification of business records. It's the first time Vance's office has suggested that tax fraud might be among the possible areas of investigation. "Even if the grand jury were testing the truth of public allegations alone, such reports, taken together, fully justify the scope of the grand jury subpoena at issue in this case," prosecutors wrote.

3. **The Office of the Special Counsel is investigating Education Secretary Betsy DeVos for potential violation of the Hatch Act.** DeVos went on Fox News and criticized Biden and the Department of Education promoted the interview through official channels. The interview from early September was also posted on the Education Department's YouTube channel and was touted in an official message from the agency. At least 12 Trump senior officials have violated the Hatch Act, according to the OSC, most of which have resulted in a warning letter to the offender.
