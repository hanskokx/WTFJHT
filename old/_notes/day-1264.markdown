1. **Trump falsely claimed that 99% of coronavirus cases are "totally harmless."** Trump made the false claim during an Independence Day speech in South Dakota. He said the U.S. has tested "over 40 million people," adding that "by so doing, we show cases, 99% of which are totally harmless." The number appears to be based on the estimated death rate, which excludes the thousands people who have spent weeks in the hospital or at home with mild to moderate symptoms that still caused debilitating health problems. The 1% death rate also narrowly focuses on the number of people who die compared to the total number of people who were infected, including those who are asymptomatic and don't experience any illness, and those with mild cases who experience fleeting symptoms.

2. **The top fund-raising official for the Trump re-election campaign tested positive for the coronavirus.** Kimberly Guilfoyle traveled to South Dakota with her boyfriend, Donald Trump Jr., and planned to attend Trump's Fourth of July fireworks display where Trump was set to speak, but Guilfoyle tested positive on Friday before the event. She did not travel on Air Force One and she is the only person in her group who tested positive. Guilfoyle is now the third person in possible proximity to Trump to have contracted the virus.

4. **Congress adjourned for a two-week recess without addressing the recent spikes in coronavirus cases across the southern and western United States**. When they return on July 20, lawmakers will have just three weeks to debate and pass a new major relief package before they adjourn again through Labor Day. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the next rescue bill will be the last. Meanwhile, enhanced unemployment benefits are scheduled to end on July 31 and both chambers of Congress remain divided on whether or not to issue additional stimulus checks to Americans.
