1. **The company that hosted Trump's indoor rally in Nevada was fined $3,000 for violating state restrictions banning large gatherings.** Sunday's rally was held at a facility owned by Xtreme Manufacturing in Henderson, Nevada, where thousands of Trump supporters — most of whom were not wearing masks — gathered to hear Trump speak. A senior public information officer for the city of Henderson said a compliance officer "observed six violations of the directives and the City's Business Operations Division has issued a Business License Notice of Violation to Xtreme Manufacturing and assessed a penalty of $3,000." The company has a month to respond to the notice and either dispute or pay the penalty. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/14/politics/trump-indoor-rally-fine-corornavirus/index.html))

2. **The Trump administration issued a broad new travel advisory warning against travel to China and Hong Kong.** The advisory says travelers are at risk of "arbitrary detention" and "arbitrary enforcement of local laws" and that China imposes "arbitrary detention and exit bans" in order to compel cooperation with investigations, pressure family members to return to China from abroad, influence civil disputes and "gain bargaining leverage over foreign governments." It also warns that U.S. travelers may be "subjected to prolonged interrogations and extended detention without due process," and that those traveling to or visiting China may be detained "without access to U.S. consular services or information about their alleged crime." A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry criticized the advisory and said the the U.S. should "fully respect the facts and should not engage in unwarranted political manipulation" when issuing such advisories.

3. **The White House trade adviser is refusing to testify to Congress about a canceled ventilator contract that Democrats say would have wasted more than $500 million.** Peter Navarro was called to testify before the House Oversight subcommittee on economic and consumer policy on Wednesday, but the hearing has been canceled after Navarro refused to appear. "Despite the astonishing scale of this waste; the loss of more than 190,000 lives; and his willingness to appear on the cable news shows of his choice — Mr. Navarro refuses to appear before Congress to answer for his actions," said subcommittee chair Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi in a statement. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/white-house-blocks-navarro-testifying-congress-about-ventilator-contract-n1240106))

4. **A federal judge in Maryland ruled that Chad Wolf is likely unlawfully serving as acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.** Judge Paula Xinis also temporarily barred the Trump administration from enforcing new asylum restrictions on members of two immigration advocacy groups. In a 69-page ruling, Judge Xinis said former acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin MacAleenan's appointment was "invalid under the agency's applicable order of succession, and so he lacked the authority to amend the order of succession to ensure Wolf's installation as Acting Secretary." He added that "by extension, because Wolf filled the role of Acting Secretary without authority, he promulgated the challenged rules also 'in excess of...authority,' and not 'in accordance with the law.'"
