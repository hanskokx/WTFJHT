1. **The White House withdrew its nomination for Pentagon comptroller.** Trump nominated Elaine McCusker last year, where she has been serving as acting comptroller since the summer and was the face of the Pentagon's budget rollout last month. Trump's decision to withdraw McCusker's nomination comes as he and his allies continue their push to oust members of his administration who have been deemed disloyal. It is unclear if McCusker will continue to serve in her current role now that her nomination has been withdrawn.

2. **The Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee says he'll back Trump's controversial nominee for the next U.S. intelligence chief.** Sen. Richard Burr said he is supportive of John Ratcliffe taking over as the next director of national intelligence. When asked what changed since Ratcliffe was first nominated last year, Burr said it was about the new "pathway to get somebody confirmed." He added: "If Democrats want to vote against him and have \[Richard\] Grenell stay on as acting is fine with me." If confirmed, Ratcliffe would replace Grenell, the Trump loyalist and ambassador to Germany who Trump installed as acting DNI.

3. **Trump said Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar should be "impeached" because they did a "quid pro quo" by dropping out and endorsing Joe Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination.** "Sounds like they made a deal. They both supported sleepy Joe," Trump told the crowd at a rally in North Carolina. "No good. Quid pro quo. They made a deal. Impeach them. They should be impeached."
