1. **Trump fired the intelligence community inspector general at the center of the Ukraine allegations that led to Trump's impeachment.** Michael Atkinson was fired on Friday, months after he delivered the whistleblower complaint to Congress about Trump's phone call with the Ukrainian president, as required by law. Trump called Atkinson a "disgrace" and said he fired him because Atkinson "did a terrible job, absolutely terrible." Trump added: "He took a fake report and he took it to Congress with an emergency, OK? Not a big Trump fan, that I can tell you." Atkinson released a statement on Sunday saying that the reason Trump fired him "derives from my having faithfully discharged my legal obligations as an independent and impartial Inspector General."

2. **The Supreme Court canceled all oral arguments for the rest of the term due to the coronavirus pandemic.** Nine cases were on the schedule for the upcoming two-week session, which begins on April 20, including a challenge to the way the U.S. elects the president. The court also canceled oral arguments for March in light of the first wave of social distancing and stay-at-home orders. It is unclear what will happen to the March and April cases, but the court said it might hear some of them if "if circumstances permit in light of public health and safety guidance at that time."

3. **The Trump administration waited until mid-March to order masks and ventilators for healthcare workers working to treat people who contracted the coronavirus.** The Department of Health and Human Services placed its first bulk order for $4.8 million worth of N95 masks on March 12, more than two months after the Trump administration received its first briefing about the outbreak on January 3. Moreover, those contracts signed by the federal government with 3M don't require the company to begin delivering the masks until the end of April, weeks after the Trump administration expects the virus to hit its apex. Three months into the crisis, the national stockpile of masks and ventilators is already nearly depleted and the number of patients is surging. "We basically wasted two months," said former HHS secretary Kathleen Sebelius.
