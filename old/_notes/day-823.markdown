1. **Consumers bore between 125% and 225% of the costs of Trump's washing machine tariffs**, according to new research from the University of Chicago and the Federal Reserve. The tariffs raised the cost of washing machines by about $86 per unit, but the cost of dryers also went up because manufacturers used the tariffs as an opportunity to raise prices on related items that weren't actually affected by the tariffs. The tariffs brought $82 million into the U.S. Treasury while raising consumer prices $1.5 billion. The tariffs did create roughly 1,800 new U.S. jobs, but each new job came at a cost of about $817,000.
