1. **The Trump administration is blocking states from using Medicaid to expand medical services as part of their responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.** Trump's reluctance to declare a national emergency over the outbreak, for example, is a key step that would create a pathway for states to receive Medicaid waivers, as previous administrations did after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Hurricane Katrina, and the H1N1 flu outbreak. The head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid has been a vocal supporter of efforts by conservative states to reduce the number of people enrolled in Medicaid, and an emergency declaration by Trump would contradict his repeated efforts to downplay the severity of the pandemic.

2. **Trump criticized the CDC over its response to COVID-19 and blamed the Obama administration for not doing enough to prepare for the next viral outbreak after the H1N1 pandemic of 2009.** In a pair of tweets, Trump — without citing evidence — claimed that the CDC knew its testing system for large-scale pandemics was inadequate, "but did nothing about it." He also called the Obama administration's response to the Swine flu pandemic a "full scale disaster" and said Obama "made changes that only complicated things further."

3. **The attending physician for Congress told Capitol Hill staffers that he expects anywhere from 70-150 million people in the U.S. to contract the coronavirus.** Dr. Brian Monahan's estimate that nearly a third of the country will contract COVID-19 lines up with the projections from other health experts, which include people who will get sick and make a full recovery — many of whom will likely contract the virus without ever feeling seriously ill. Monahan said roughly 80% of the people who contract the virus will ultimately be fine.

4. **The acting director of national intelligence ordered a department-wide hiring freeze and a review of the agency's mission and personnel.** Richard Grenell ordered the large-scale reorganization of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which some of his predecessors had considered but set aside, even though his role as acting head of the agency is a temporary one. An assistant director of national intelligence said the move was "not an effort to purge," but simply an attempt to "make sure scarce intelligence community resources are used in the best way possible." The last hiring freeze took place in 2018 under Trump's first DNI, Dan Coates. Trump recently tapped Rep. John Ratcliffe to be his fifth DNI, but the Senate has yet to set a date for Ratcliffe's confirmation hearing.
