1. **Trump invoked national security in order to claim a new power to deny asylum to virtually any immigrant who crossed the border illegally.** Trump is expected to announce on Friday which countries the new rules will apply to, and they will go into effect as soon as they are published in the Federal Register. The new rules will change longstanding asylum laws that allow people who are fleeing persecution and violence in their home countries to seek protection in the United States. The new rules will prevent people from seeking that protection if they don't enter the country at an official port of entry.

2. **An independent expert says the video distributed by Sarah Huckabee Sanders to support its argument for revoking Jim Acosta's press pass was doctored.** The video was doctored to make Acosta look more aggressive than he actually was during an exchange with a White House intern.

3. **In a last-minute act, Jeff Sessions drastically limited the use of consent decrees between Justice Department officials and local police departments.** Consent decrees allow federal law enforcement officials to use court-enforced agreements to overhaul local police departments accused of civil rights abuses and violations. Sessions added three strict new requirements for the agreements: top political appointees must sign off on the deals, department lawyers must show evidence of additional violations beyond unconstitutional behavior, and the deals must have a sunset date.

4. **Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's nephew says she is "up and working" after being hospitalized for broken ribs following a fall in her office.** "The last I heard she was up and working, of course, because what else would she be doing, and cracking jokes," Daniel Stiepleman said. "I canâ€™t promise they were good jokes but they were jokes."

5. **Ryan Zinke is preparing to leave his role as Secretary of the Interior.** Zinke has been exploring potential roles at Fox News, the energy industry, and other business sectors as it becomes increasingly likely that he will no longer have a job in Trump's cabinet and as ethics investigations into his behavior in office continue to mount. Trump recently told reporters that word on Zinke's future in the White House may come "in about a week." ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/08/ryan-zinke-fox-news-956537))
