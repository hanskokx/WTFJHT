1. **The government shut down for five hours last night** for the second time in three weeks before the House passed a sweeping spending bill, which Trump signed into law early Friday morning. The measure keeps the government open until March 23. The bill also increases federal military, domestic, and disaster relief spending by hundreds of billions of dollars.

2. **The FBI was monitoring former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page at a time when he spoke with Steve Bannon about Russia in Jan. 2017.** The details of the call are still vague, and the significance of the possible FBI recording depends on the content of their conversation, but the fact that the FBI was monitoring Page at the time means the Russia investigation may have captured interactions between two of the highest-ranking Trump officials just days before the inauguration.

4. **Dozens of White House employees still don't have permanent security clearance.** The employees have been working for months with temporary approvals as they await permanent clearance. They continue to handle sensitive and classified information while they wait for the FBI to complete their respective background probes and security assessments.

5. **Thursday's drop in the stock market was the second-biggest single-day drop in history** â€” Monday's drop was the largest. If the Dow drops 214 points today, it will make this the worst week in history. In total, the stock market has lost 40 percent of the value added since Trump took office.
