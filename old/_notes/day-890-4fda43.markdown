1. **Trump met with Putin at the G20 Summit and touted his "very, very good relationship" with the Russian leader, before smiling and telling him, "Don't meddle in the election."** Trump's meeting with Putin was their first since last year's summit in Helsinki when Trump took Putin's side over his own U.S. intelligence agencies on the question of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump has been under increasing pressure to criticize Putin publicly as the 2020 election gets closer. When asked whether he would tell Putin not to interfere in 2020, Trump smiled, raised his finger toward Putin, and repeated: "Don't meddle in the election."

2. **Trump joked with Putin that they should "get rid" of journalists**. "Get rid of them," Trump said to Putin during the same press conference that he joked about election interference. "Fake news is a great term, isn’t it? You don’t have this problem in Russia but we do." Putin responded in English: "We also have. It’s the same."

3. **Trump said he asked White House lawyers to try to delay the 2020 Census until a citizenship question can be added** after the Supreme Court ruled that his administration had provided a "contrived" justification for adding the question. "Seems totally ridiculous that our government, and indeed Country, cannot ask a basic question of Citizenship in a very expensive, detailed and important Census, in this case for 2020," Trump tweeted. "I have asked the lawyers if they can delay the Census, no matter how long, until the United States Supreme Court is given additional information from which it can make a final and decisive decision on this very critical matter."

4. **Mitch McConnell says he would be willing to consider allowing a vote on a Democratic nominee to the Supreme Court if Trump loses reelection**. McConnell said it would be "politically unsustainable" to extend his current blockade of Democratic nominees into a new presidency. "I can’t imagine any scenario under which the early part of a president’s term you would not have a vote," McConnell said. "That doesn’t mean the person would necessarily be confirmed." McConnell refused to allow Obama to fill a vacancy on the Court after Justice Scalia died, allowing Trump to subsequently fill two vacancies and swing the Court back to a conservative majority.
