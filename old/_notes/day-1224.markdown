1. **Trump spent Memorial Day Weekend mocking female politicians, tweeting about conspiracy theories, and golfing**. In a series of tweets and retweets on Saturday and Sunday, Trump made fun of Stacey Abrams' weight, mocked Nancy Pelosi's appearance, and called Hillary Clinton a "skank." He also revived a long-debunked conspiracy theory that MSNBC's Joe Scarborough may have killed one of his interns and claimed, without evidence, that mail-in voting consistently results in ballot stuffing and voter fraud. At the same time, the U.S. death toll from the coronavirus closed in on 100,000. On Monday, Trump visited Arlington National Cemetery and Fort McHenry in Baltimore in honor of Memorial Day.

2. **Trump threatened to move the Republican National Convention out of Charlotte if North Carolina's Democratic governor doesn't allow the event to go forward at full capacity**. The convention is expected to draw roughly 50,000 people, and the state's health and human services secretary has said that the GOP should "plan for the worst" because large gatherings will be a "very big challenge" if the number of cases in the state continues to increase. Trump tweeted that the "many thousands of enthusiastic Republicans, and others" who are planning to head to North Carolina in August "must be immediately given an answer by the Governor as to whether or not the space will be allowed to be fully occupied." If not, Trump added, "we will be reluctantly forced to find, with all of the jobs and economic development it brings, another Republican National Convention site." Florida Republicans, meanwhile, said they would "welcome the opportunity to host the Republican National Convention" if Trump decides to pull the event out of Charlotte.

3. **Trump announced the suspension of all travel to the U.S. from Brazil by non-U.S. citizens starting on Thursday.** Brazil has the second largest number of reported coronavirus cases behind the U.S. and has become a hot spot for the virus in the southern hemisphere. "Today, the President has taken decisive action to protect our country by suspending the entry of aliens who have been in Brazil during the 14-day period before seeking admittance to the United States," White House press secretary Kaleigh McEnany said in a statement. "These new restrictions do not apply to the flow of commerce between the United States and Brazil."

4. **The WHO temporarily suspended testing of hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus treatment in order to review safety concerns about the drug**. The suspension comes in response to a global study of 96,000 hospitalized patients across six continents that found patients who took the drug were more likely to die or develop heart irregularities than those who did nothing to treat the virus. Trump has repeatedly promoted hydroxychloroquine as a "game changer" and recently claimed he has been taking the drug for weeks as a preventative measure against the virus.
