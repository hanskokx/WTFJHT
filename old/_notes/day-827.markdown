1. **Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly threatened to jail White House officials who refuse to comply with oversight or testimony requests from congressional committees.** Connolly sits on the House Oversight Committee, and warned that the committee would use "any and all power in our command" to ensure compliance with its requests and subpoenas, "whether that's a contempt citation, whether that's going to court and getting that citation enforced, whether it's fines, whether it's possible incarceration."

2. **Trump called the Russia investigation "an attempted overthrow of the United States government."** In his first interview since the redacted version of the Mueller report was released, Trump told Sean Hannity that the investigation was "a coup," and complained that Mueller and his team had gone "hog wild to find something about the administration which obviously wasn't there." He said people in his campaign suffered greatly because of the probe and criticized Mueller's team for spending the last two years "ruining their lives." He also warned that some of the people involved in the investigation should be "very nervous" now that the investigation has ended.

3. **The White House is calling on key Republicans in Congress to quickly raise the debt ceiling** in order to avoid a budget impasse that could damage the economy later in the year. Other budget discussions between lawmakers have broken down, which could prevent Congress from meeting several fiscal deadlines in September that affect the stock and labor markets, as well as overall economic growth.

4. **Trump said the U.S. didn't pay any money to North Korea in exchange for the return of Otto Warmbier.** He was responding to [a report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/north-korea-issued-2-million-bill-for-comatose-otto-warmbiers-care/2019/04/25/0e8022a0-66ad-11e9-a698-2a8f808c9cfb_story.html?noredirect=on) that Trump approved a $2 million payment to Pyongyang for the American student's care while he was detained. "No money was paid to North Korea for Otto Warmbier, not two Million Dollars, not anything else," Trump tweeted. North Korea sent the Treasury Department a bill for $2 million, which remained unpaid through 2017, but it wasn't clear whether Trump paid the invoice at a later date.
