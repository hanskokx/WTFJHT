1. **The Trump administration ordered the U.S. ambassador to the European Union not to appear before House lawmakers for a planned deposition** as part of the impeachment inquiry. Lawmakers want information about Ambassador Gordon Sondland's activities related to Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden and his son. Sondland said he was willing and happy to testify, but he did not appear as scheduled this morning after he was ordered not to by the State Department. Sondland's attorney said that as a State Department employee, Sondland had no choice but to comply with the order. House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff called the White House’s move to block Sondland from testifying "further acts of obstruction of a coequal branch of government."

* **The White House all but declared war on the House impeachment inquiry on Tuesday**, intervening for the first time to block the testimony of a key witness as President Trump signaled his administration would try to starve investigators of more witnesses and documents. The decision to prevent EU ambassador Sondland from speaking with investigators for three House committees provoked a conflict with potentially profound consequences for the inquiry and for Trump himself.

1. **The Trump Organization is refusing pay a legal bill after it lost a lengthy court battle with the Scottish government**. A Scottish court ruled earlier this year that the Trump Organization must pay the Scottish government’s legal costs after Trump attempted and failed to block the construction of an 11-turbine wind farm in Aberdeen Bay. Scottish government officials say the Trump Organization has refused to accept the bill, which amounts to tens of thousands of pounds.

2. **Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is facing possible sanctions or contempt of court over her decision to continue collecting payments on the debt of former students at bankrupt Corinthian Colleges Inc**. Under DeVos, the agency has already seized tax refunds and wages from at least 1,808 students. "I’m not sure if this is contempt or sanctions," U.S. Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim told Department of Education lawyers at a hearing on Monday. "At best it is gross negligence, at worst it’s an intentional flouting of my order."
