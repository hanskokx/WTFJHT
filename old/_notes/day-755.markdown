1. **Trump intends to sign the bipartisan border security deal and avoid another partial government shutdown.** Trump told reporters that he wasn't happy with the current deal, saying that he will continue to add things to it, but two sources who have spoken directly with Trump say he plans to sign it anyway. The agreement must be signed into law in both chambers of Congress and signed by Trump before the end of the week in order to avoid another shutdown.

2. **Democrats in the House are planning to launch their own vast probe into Trump's connections to Russia.** Using their new subpoena power, House Democrats plan to focus heavily on potential money laundering by using the multiple committees they control to host dramatic hearings and public sessions that could stretch into 2020. The plans were outlined yesterday at a roundtable with reporters, where a Democratic member of Congress said they plan to interview new witnesses and go back to previous witnesses who they believe "stonewalled" committees under the Republican majority. The House Intelligence Committee will lead the effort, with the House Financial Services Committee focusing on money laundering and the House Foreign Affairs Committee looking into possible Russian connections.

The debt has been accelerating since the passage of Trump's $1.5 trillion tax cut in December 2017 and the decision by Congress to increase military spending.
