status/ **Major parts of the federal government shut down indefinitely at midnight last night when Trump tanked a deal on a bipartisan spending bill because it didn't include money for his border wall.** Agencies in charge of federal parks, law enforcement, taxes and transportation ran out of money last night. Nearly 400,000 federal workers won't work or get paid until a deal can be reached. Several services will be also unavailable, and the impacts will get worse the longer the shutdown lasts.
