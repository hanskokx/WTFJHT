1. **The Supreme Court ruled that Trump violated federal law when he ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in 2017.** The court ruled that while Trump did have the legal authority to end the program, the way in which he did it was illegal. The 5-4 decision was written by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and joined by the court’s four liberals. "The dispute before the Court is not whether DHS may rescind DACA," Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. "All parties agree that it may. The dispute is instead primarily about the procedure the agency followed in doing so."

2. **The federal government is sitting on a stockpile of 63 million doses of hydroxychloroquine that it can't distribute because the FDA revoked permission for the drug to be used to treat coronavirus patients.** The U.S. started stockpiling the anti-malarial drug in late March after Trump began touting it as a "game-changer" that was a "very powerful" treatment for COVID-19. Now, the FDA says there is "no reason to believe" the drug is effective in treating or protecting against the virus. The national stockpile also includes 2 million doses of chloroquine, a related drug manufactured by Bayer. The stockpile had already distributed 31 million doses of hydroxychloroquine by the time the FDA revoked its authorization.

3. **The Justice Department asked a federal judge to order John Bolton to halt production of his memoir, claiming that it contains classified information.** The DOJ also urged the judge to make sure the restraining order it's seeking prevents Bolton's publisher, Simon & Schuster, from distributing copies of the book once they receive notice of it. In a court filing, the Trump administration claims that publication and distribution of the book, titled "The Room Where It Happened," would "damage the national security of the United States." The latest move is a significant escalation from the DOJ's original lawsuit alleging that Bolton failed to complete the pre-publication review process he agreed to undergo when he received his security clearance to become Trump's national security adviser.

4. **The DOJ asked Congress to take up legislation that would remove protections for large tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter.** The stated goal is to incentivize tech giants to address criminal activity on their platforms, such as child exploitation, terrorism or cyber stalking, while increasing transparency for users whenever a company removes otherwise legal content. In a statement, Attorney General William Barr said the reforms are "targeted at platforms to make certain they are appropriately addressing illegal and exploitive \[*sic*\] content while continuing to preserve a vibrant, open and competitive internet."

5. **Trump's pick to lead the U.S. Agency for Global Media started his tenure by sidelining or firing senior leaders at the agency and the chiefs of all the government-sponsored foreign broadcast networks that his agency oversees.** Micahel Pack showed up to work on Wednesday and immediately fired the heads of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, the Office of Cuban Broadcasting, which oversees Radio and Television Martí, and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks, which runs Alhurra and Radio Sawa. The two highest-ranking officials at Voice of America resigned days earlier in anticipation of Pack's arrival. Pack also dissolved the advisory boards overseeing each of the networks and replaced them with his own aides. Pack gave no reason for his actions other than his own authority to do so.
