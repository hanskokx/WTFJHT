1. **The Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Trump Jr.** to answer questions about his previous testimony regarding the 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians. Trump Jr. is the first of Trump's children to be subpoenaed in the ongoing congressional investigations into Russia's involvement in the 2016 election. The committee is interested in comparing Trump Jr.'s testimony to the answers he gave to previous Senate investigators in 2017, and in learning more about how much Trump Jr. told his father about what transpired at the Trump Tower meeting.

2. **The House Judiciary Committee voted 24-to-16 to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for failing to deliver the unredacted version of the Mueller report.** The contempt vote represents the first official House move to punish a government official because of the ongoing battle over the Mueller report. "We are now in a constitutional crisis," said Committee chair Jerry Nadler. The Justice Department said the move was unnecessary and was meant to stoke a fight.

3. **Trump joked about shooting migrants at the border during a rally in Florida.** Trump was complaining that "border security people" are prohibited from shooting migrants approaching the border when he asked, "How do you stop these people?" One of his supporters shouted, "Shoot them!" Trump paused, laughed, and responded, "Only in the Panhandle you can get away with that statement. Only in the panhandle."
