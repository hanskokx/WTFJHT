1. **Attorneys for the anonymous whistleblower at the center of the Trump impeachment inquiry have been receiving multiple death threats** and other abusive messages. At least one of the death threats has led to an investigation by law enforcement. None of the threats have been deemed credible, although the FBI has yet to make an official statement  about them.

2. **Two more career diplomats will testify before House impeachment investigators behind closed doors today**. Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson are expected to tell lawmakers that Trump and Giuliani's views of Ukraine were out of step with other White House and State Department officials. Anderson, who served as assistant to former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, will discuss his attempts as a Foreign Service officer to show support for Ukraine, only to have those efforts quashed by the White House. Anderson will also tell lawmakers that John Bolton warned about the influence that Giuliani had on U.S. policymaking during a meeting with top U.S. officials in mid-June. Croft will explain how "throughout" her time in the Trump administration she heard Trump "describe Ukraine as a corrupt country," both "directly and indirectly."

3. **A former Republican congressman turned lobbyist repeatedly attempted to get the American ambassador to Ukraine fired over her association with Democrats**. Robert Livingston told a Catherine Croft on multiple occasions that Marie Yovanovitch was an "Obama holdover" who was "associated with George Soros" and should be fired. Croft is expected to tell lawmakers about Livingston's appeals to have Yovanovitch fired during her closed door testimony today. "It was not clear to me at the time — or now — at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch," Croft's opening statement reads.

4. **Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney didn't know about the raid to assassinate Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi until after the raid was already underway**. The White House Chief of Staff is typically a central figure in any major action by a U.S. president and is placed in charge of coordinating logistics, public statements and notifications of congressional leaders and allies. Rather than sitting alongside Trump in the Situation Room as the raid unfolded, Mulvaney was at home in South Carolina when Trump tweeted on Saturday that “Something very big has just happened!” Mulvaney was briefed on the raid later that night.

5. **Georgia plans to cancel roughly 315,000 voter registrations ahead of the 2020 presidential election** and the state's "double barrel" Senate election, where both Senate seats are up for grabs. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger's office will send notices to voters who have been inactive for the past couple of elections and give them 30 days to return the notice if they do not wish to have their voter registrations canceled. The number of potential cancellations constitutes roughly 4 percent of Georgians on the voter rolls.
