1. **Trump told a group of lawmakers at a meeting on border security that he can't accept the offer from Democrats to re-open the government because "I would look foolish if I did that,"** according to an anonymous source. Trump and the Democrats remain at an impasse over funding for Trump's border wall, and Nancy Pelosi has remained firm on her refusal to accommodate Trump's demands. "We can go through the back and forth," Pelosi said. "No. How many more times can we say no? Nothing for the wall." Sen. Lindsay Graham, meanwhile, has been pressuring Trump to hold firm as well. "If he gives in now, that’s the end of 2019 in terms of him being an effective president," Graham said. "That’s the probably the end of his presidency."

2. **Pelosi also suggested that she believes Trump can be indicted, even while he is the sitting president.** When asked, "Do you believe the special counsel should honor and observe the Department of Justice guidance that states a sitting president cannot be indicted?" Pelosi responded: "No, I mean I don't think — I do not think that that is conclusive. No, I do not." She continued: "I think that is an open discussion. I think that is an open discussion in terms of the law." Pelosi's statements make her the highest ranking public to suggest that Trump can be indicted while still in office.

3. **The confirmation of 70 of Trump's judicial nominees remains in flux after Sens. Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer failed to reach an agreement on how to move the nominations forward.** The pending nominations will now be sent back to the White House to be re-nominated. The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to hold an extra-long session at some point in the next few weeks to consider all the remaining nominees who were awaiting a vote on the Senate floor or waiting for a committee vote.

4. **One of the first new pieces of legislation in 2019 includes a provision that would require all presidential nominees to disclose at least 10 years of their tax returns.** Vice presidents would also be required to turn over the last decade of their tax returns. The documents would then be posted on the FEC's website for the public to view. The legislation is not expected to pass the Republican-controlled Senate or be signed by Trump.
