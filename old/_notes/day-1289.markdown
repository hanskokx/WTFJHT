1. **The Department of Homeland Security compiled "intelligence reports" about the work of American journalists covering protests in Portland.** The Office of Intelligence and Analysis has distributed three Open Source Intelligence Reports to federal law enforcement agencies and others. The reports include written descriptions and images of the tweets written by a New York Times journalist and the editor in chief of the blog Lawfare and noted that they had published leaked, unclassified documents about DHS operations in Portland. A DHS spokesperson said in a statement that after he learned about the practice, Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf directed the OIA to "immediately discontinue collecting information involving members of the press" and that in no way does Wolf "condone this practice and he has immediately ordered an inquiry into the matter."

2. **Trump threatened to send the National Guard into Portland to clear out protesters, whom he referred to as a "beehive of terrorists."** Trump claimed Portland was rife with professional agitators and anarchists and that "many should be arrested." He added that he would send the National Guard to suppress them if local officials failed to get the situation under control over the next two days. He also said the governor of Oregon and the mayor of Portland "don't know what they're doing," and complained that it's "not our job to go clean out the cities, it’s supposed to be done by local law enforcement."

3. **Trump defended his suggestion that the U.S. should delay the November election.** During a press conference that was supposed to be about the coronavirus, Trump again attacked the process of mail-in voting. "You’re sending out hundreds of millions of universal mail-in ballots. Hundreds of millions," he said. "Where are they going? Who are they being sent to?" He again falsely claimed that mail-in voting and absentee ballots lead to more voter fraud, vastly overstated the number of ballots that would be needed, and continued sowing doubt about the election process in general. "I don’t want to see a crooked election," he said. "This will be the most rigged election in history if that happens."

4. **Dr. Anthony Fauci will testify today before a Congressional coronavirus subcommittee.** Fauci was initially prevented from testifying by the Trump administration by saying he was unavailable for the entire month of July, but his appearance was approved only after House Majority Whip James Clyburn wrote to Mike Pence. Fauci's testimony comes two days after the U.S. experienced its 150,000th death from the virus, more than any other country in the world.
