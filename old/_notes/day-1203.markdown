1. **On the same day Trump praised his administration for solving "every problem" and taking care of "all of the things," members of his own administration were privately warning that states were still experiencing shortages of masks, gowns and other medical gear.** A recording of an interagency conference call on May 1 between FEMA and HHS officials across the country began with the director of the Centers for Disease Control's influenza division saying, "The numbers of deaths definitely will be high." Other officials discussed their ongoing struggle to keep up with a flood of requests from governors for more medical equipment and PPE, while Trump was out telling the public that the federal government had "loaded up hospitals with things to take care of people" and that we have "millions and millions of masks" available.

2. **The governor of Texas admitted during a private phone call with state lawmakers that "every scientific and medical report shows" reopening states leads to an increase in coronavirus cases in those states.** Gov. Greg Abbott publicly announced plans that same week to reopen Texas, despite warnings from scientists and public health officials. "Listen," Abbott said on the call, "the fact of the matter is pretty much every scientific and medical report shows that whenever you have a reopening—whether you want to call it a reopening of businesses or of just a reopening of society—in the aftermath of something like this, it actually will lead to an increase and spread." He added: "The more that you have people out there, the greater the possibility is for transmission. So, the goal never has been to get transmission down to zero. It never can be." A spokesperson confirmed the audio from the call was authentic.
