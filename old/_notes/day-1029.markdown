1. **A U.S. appeals court ruled that Trump's accounting firm must comply with a congressional subpoena for eight years of Trump's tax returns**. The U.S. Court of Appeals in D.C. in an 8-3 vote rejected Trump's arguments that the subpoena issued to his accounting firm Mazars USA was illegitimate. Trump's attorneys argued that Congress didn't have the authority to request his business records because the House Oversight and Reform Committee only needed them to determine whether Trump broke existing laws, not whether to enact a new law. Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow said they plan to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.

2. **Lindsey Graham blocked a resolution in the Senate that would have formally recognized the Armenian genocide at the hands of the Ottoman Empire hours after meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan**. Turkey does not recognize the killing of 1.5 million Armenians that began in 1914 as genocide. The resolution passed the House in a 405-11 vote. Graham claimed the bill was an attempt to "sugarcoat history or try to rewrite it."

3. **Trump suggested classifying all migrants who enter the U.S. without permission as "enemy combatants" and sending them to Guantanamo Bay**, according to a forthcoming book by an anonymous senior Trump administration official. Trump proposed changing the classification of all undocumented immigrants to enemy combatants as a way of deterring them from coming to the U.S. The book says Trump's idea was quickly and quietly opposed. "Before the president could make a public case for the concept," the author writes, "officials quashed it."
