1. **Facebook's chief information security officer, Alex Stamos, is leaving the company amid heightened tensions and disagreements among top Facebook executives** over their response to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections and potential interference in the 2018 midterms. Stamos has been overseeing Facebook's security team of 120 people, which is currently down to only three people. Stamos plans to leave the company by August.

2. **Trump is openly discussing firing one of his lawyers, another lawyer is considering resigning, and a third lawyer recently joined Trump's legal team.** Ty Cobb, who has pushed for cooperation with Mueller's investigation, appears to be on the chopping block. John Dowd has reportedly considered leaving the team because he has proved unable to control Trump's behavior. And Trump recently hired Joseph E. diGenova, a regular Fox News commentator who has suggested in recent months that the FBI and Justice Department conspired to deny Trump his "civil rights."

3. **The Supreme Court has rejected a request from Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania to block the new congressional map that improves the party parity of the voting districts in the state**. This is the second time the Supreme Court has refused to get involved in Pennsylvania's partisan political battles. The latest decision means that the 2018 midterm elections will likely be held using a map that is much more favorable to Democrats than in previous elections.
