1. **Trump personally directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about his plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow in order to obscure his involvement in the deal.** Trump also approved a plan by Cohen to visit Russia and set up a meeting with Vladimir Putin in order to start the negotiation process for the Moscow tower project. "Make it happen," Trump told Cohen. Trump's children, Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr., both received regular updates from Cohen with details about the project. Cohen, at the direction of Trump, told Mueller's team that the Moscow tower negotiations ended in January 2016 in order to "minimize links between the Moscow Project" and Trump "in hopes of limiting the ongoing Russia investigations." The revelation marks the first time Trump is known to have directly and explicitly ordered one of his subordinates to lie about his dealings with Russia.

2. **The wife of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker sent an email to a reporter and said Mueller's investigation is "wrapping up."** Marci Whitaker was responding to an article in Slate that criticized her husband and argued that the Senate should not confirm him as the next attorney general. She objected to the reporter's suggestion that Whitaker should recuse himself from the Mueller investigation. "If abundance of caution is the standard," she wrote, "anyone who ever spent 5 minutes contemplating the topic would need to do so." She continued: "And by all means, assume that a person who speculated on a hypothetical scenario would then put some dark plan into motion, when by all accounts, the investigation is wrapping up and they \[sic\] eyes of the nation are upon them."

3. **Mitch McConnell blocked another bill to reopen the government, marking the third time he has knocked down House-passed government funding bills.** McConnell gave no explanation for the move, but he has said over the last few weeks that he will not bring government funding bills to a vote unless the bill is the result of negotiations between Trump and the Democrats.

4. **The White House canceled its delegation's planned trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.** "Out of consideration for the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay," Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement, "and to ensure his team can assist as needed, President Trump has canceled his Delegation's trip to the World Economic Forum." Trump recently canceled his own trip to Davos, but cabinet members and others from his delegation were also scheduled to meet at the annual economic conference.
