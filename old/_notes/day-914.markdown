1. **Trump said Mueller shouldn't be allowed to testify before Congress about Trump's ties to Russia and instances of possible obstruction of justice.** Trump tweeted that "Mueller should not be given another bite at the apple" by testifying before two congressional committees on July 24, because "in the end it will be bad for him." Trump complained that the "phony Democrats" in Congress "have done nothing but waste time on this ridiculous Witch Hunt," and again called for investigations into Hillary Clinton instead of himself and his campaign.

2. **House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said there is "very substantial evidence" in Mueller's report that Trump is "guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors."** The House Judiciary Committee would be in charge of leading impeachment proceedings if the House decides to move forward with articles of impeachment in the future. Mueller is scheduled to testify on July 24 in front of both the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees in back-to-back public hearings, where he will answer questions about the contents of his report and his 22-month-long investigation.

1. **Trump wants to meet with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer "ASAP" to discuss conditions at the U.S.-Mexico border** after Schumer took a tour of migrant detention facilities and called them "inhumane." "Senator Chuck Schumer has finally gone to the Southern Border with some Democrat Senators. This is a GREAT thing!" Trump tweeted.

2. **A new study by the pro-immigration group New American Economy found that 45% of the Fortune 500 companies in the U.S. were founded by immigrants and their children**. The same study also found that that number is growing, despite claims that immigration leads to lower wages and fewer jobs for American citizens. The Fortune 500 companies examined in the study brought in a combined $1.6 trillion in annual revenue last year, and they employed 13.5 million people. On average, the companies founded by immigrants also employed 11% more people than the Fortune 500 companies with non-immigrant founders.

3. **A Republican political organization in Illinois posted and then deleted a movie-style poster depicting the four congresswomen of color who have been attacked by Trump as "The Jihad Squad."** The image was posted by the account of the Republican County Chairman's Association of Illinois. The poster included the slogan, "Political Jihad Is Their Game," and depicted Rep. Ayanna Pressley aiming a gun with a smile on her face. In a follow-up post, the organization's president Mark Shaw said that "an image which was not authorized by me was posted on the Facebook page of the Illinois Republican County Chairmen’s Association ('RCCA')." He continued: "I am sorry if anyone who saw the image was offended by the contents."
