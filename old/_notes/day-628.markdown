1. **Rick Gates requested proposals in 2016 from an Israeli psychological operations company to create fake online identities and use social media manipulation to gather intelligence and help defeat Republican primary race opponents and Hillary Clinton.** Gates joined the Trump campaign along with Paul Manafort. Both have been indicted on multiple charges of financial fraud and tax evasion. One proposal from the company, known as Psy-Group, called for the creation of fake online personas to target and persuade 5,000 delegates to the 2016 Republican National Convention by attacking Ted Cruz. Another called for opposition research and "complementary intelligence activities" aimed at Clinton and her close allies. There is no evidence that the Trump campaign acted on the proposals, but Psy-Group's owner Joel Zamel did meet with Donald Trump Jr. in August 2016.

2. **The Trump administration plans to remove a federal ban on summer sales of high-ethanol gasoline blends.** The move is seen as a reward to Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee and presided over Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court. The policy change would allow year-round sales of gasoline blends with up to 15 percent ethanol, 5 percent higher than typical blends. The EPA currently bans high-ethanol blends during the summer because they contribute to smog on hot days.

3. **Trump offered an apology to Brett Kavanaugh and his family "on behalf of our nation" during his swearing-in ceremony at the White House.** Trump also claimed that Kavanaugh was "proven innocent" and said that the confirmation process was based on "lies and deception." Kavanaugh said the process was "contentious and emotional" but added that he retained "no bitterness."

4. **More than a thousand noncitizens may have been registered to vote in California due to a processing error.** The California Department of Motor Vehicles admitted that a mistake had caused as many as 1,500 noncitizens to be registered to vote in the state. A Canadian citizen and legal permanent resident of the U.S. first brought attention to the mistake after he received a letter in the mail telling him he was registered to vote.
