1. **Trump signed an executive order and three memoranda to delay payroll taxes, student loan payments, and evictions through the end of the year.** The action also extends an additional $400-per-week in unemployment benefits — down from $600 — until 2021. Trump said he signed four "executive orders," but only the one on housing is an actual executive order. The other three are marked "memorandum," which carries less weight. The actions themselves are also less substantial than they sound. For example, payroll taxes will be deferred, not waived, meaning they will be due at a later date. Key officials were only asked to "consider" whether evictions should be banned, and his action on unemployment assistance insists that state governments pay a quarter of the costs. The actions are expected to draw legal challenges, as the U.S. Constitution says any changes to taxes or spending are supposed to come from Congress. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called them "absurdly unconstitutional."

2. **Sen. Richard Blumenthal called on the Trump administration to declassify reports detailing Russian efforts to influence the 2020 elections.** Top Democrats in both chambers of Congress have called for the FBI to provide lawmakers with a "defensive briefing" regarding what appears to be a "concerted foreign interference campaign" targeting Congress. Blumenthal said the intelligence he heard during a classified briefing "is absolutely chilling, startling and shocking," adding that the intelligence suggests previous Soviet and Russian techniques "are looking like child's play compared to what they're doing now globally."

3. **At least 97,000 children in the U.S. tested positive for COVID-19 during the last two weeks of July.** A new report from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s Hospital Association says at least 338,000 children have tested positive since the pandemic began, meaning more than a quarter have tested positive during those two weeks. More than seven out of 10 infections were from states in the southern and western U.S., although the report did not include complete data from Texas and information from parts of New York State outside of New York City. Missouri, Oklahoma, Alaska, Nevada, Idaho and Montana were among the states with the highest percent increase of child infections, while New York City, New Jersey and other states in the Northeast, where the virus peaked in March and April, had the lowest percent increase.

4. **China announced sanctions against 11 U.S. citizens in response to earlier U.S. sanctions against 11 Chinese officials.** Among those targeted were Senators Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton, Josh Hawley and Pat Toomey and Representative Chris Smith, as well as individuals at U.S. non-profits and rights organizations. A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry said China "has decided to impose sanctions on individuals who have behaved egregiously on Hong Kong-related issues" in response "to those wrong U.S. behaviors." It is unclear what the latest round of sanctions will entail.
