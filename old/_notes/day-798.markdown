1. **Trump called on House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff to resign after Mueller's report did not conclude that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 election.** Trump said Schiff "spent two years knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking" and should therefore "be forced to resign from Congress!" Schiff has continued to insist that "undoubtedly there was collusion" and has vowed that his committee will continue to look into the counterintelligence aspects of Mueller's investigation.

2. **Attorney General William Barr is expected to miss the House Democrats' April 2 deadline for him to turn in the full Mueller report to Congress.** If Barr misses the deadline, Democrats are expected to subpoena the Justice Department for the full report. Barr also said he couldn't promise that a full, unredacted report would be provided to Congress or the American people. "Weâ€™re not happy about that, to put it mildly," said House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler. Nadler says the report is several hundred pages long, but less than 1,000.

3. **Trump threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border because he says Mexico and several Central American countries are not doing enough to stem the flow of migrants coming to the United States.** "Mexico is doing NOTHING to help stop the flow of illegal immigrants to our Country," Trump tweeted. "They are all talk and no action." Trump singled out Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador in particular for having "taken our money for years" but not doing anything about migration. Trump continued: "May close the Southern Border!" ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/28/trump-mexico-border-migrant-surge-1241307))

4. **Energy secretary Rick Perry approved six secret authorizations for companies looking to sell nuclear power technology and assistance to Saudi Arabia.** The White House is also quietly trying to lock down a deal that involves sharing U.S. nuclear power technology with the Saudis and building two nuclear power plants in the country. Russia, South Korea, the United States, and other countries are all competing to win the deal, and Saudi Arabia is expected to announce the winners later this week.

5. **Trump says the FBI and Department of Justice will review the "outrageous" decision by prosecutors in Chicago to drop all charges against actor Jussie Smollett**, calling the decision "an embarrassment to our Nation!" The DOJ declined to comment, and Smollett's attorney said "we have nothing to be concerned about" when it comes to the federal probe.
