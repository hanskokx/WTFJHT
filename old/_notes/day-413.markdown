* **Trump's top lawyer Don McGahn has issued 24 ethics waivers to allow lobbyists, lawyers, and others to participate in matters that they previously lobbied for or worked on for private clients.** The waivers were signed despite the fact that Trump signed an executive order a week after his inauguration that barred former lobbyists and lawyers from doing exactly that, purportedly as a way to prevent corruption and "drain the swamp."

* **Jared Kushner met with Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto on Wednesday in an attempt to reduce tensions between the U.S. and Mexico** in the wake of a contentious phone call about Trump's proposed wall on the southern U.S. border. Kushner, however, did not invite the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico to accompany him on the trip. Ambassador Roberta Jacobson is among the State Department's top Latin American experts, with more than 30 years of diplomatic experience in the region.

* **Trump asked two witnesses about their discussions with Robert Mueller's investigators**. In one episode, Trump wanted the White House counsel, Don McGahn, to issue a statement denying that McGahn told investigators that Trump once asked him to fire special counsel Robert Mueller. McGahn had to remind Trump that he did ask him to have Mueller fired. In the other, Trump asked Reince Priebus how his interview with Mueller's investigators had gone, and whether they were "nice."

* **California Gov. Jerry Brown shot back at Jeff Sessions and Trump after the administration sued the state over it's immigration laws**. Brown called the administration "full of liars" and said Robert "Mueller is closing in. There are more indictments to come. So obviously the attorney general has found it hard to be just a normal attorney general. He's been caught up in the whirlwind."

* **The head of Trump's voter fraud commission acknowledged that their plan for identifying voter fraud wasn't a good one**.
