1. **Rep. Elijah Cummings says one of his first priorities when Congress returns will be to investigate why the Trump administration decided to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census.** "There are certain things that mandate that we look at immediately. One of them is the census, because that’s right around the corner," Cummings said. Last month, Cummings asked for an official probe into why the Commerce Department added the question to the census, which critics say could serve to depress responses to the census from immigrants, many of whom live in Democratic-leaning communities.

2. **Sen. Lindsay Graham says he supports a bill to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation from any politically motivated firings.** Graham also said that he would urge Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to allow a vote on the bill. "I would certainly vote for it," Graham said. "I don’t see any movement to get rid of Mueller. But it probably would be good to have this legislation in place just for the future." Sen. Chuck Grassley said he also supports the bill, but he won't be lobbying McConnell to allow the measure to move forward.

3. **Trump berated British Prime Minister Theresa May when she called Air Force One to discuss the midterm results with him.** He criticized May for not doing enough to contain Iran after the U.S reimposed sanctions, and he questioned her approach to Brexit. He also complained that U.S. trade deals with European nations were not fair. U.S. and E.U. officials said May's aides and the Prime Minister herself were shaken by the call.
