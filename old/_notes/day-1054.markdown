1. **The House Judiciary Committee is in session to hear the evidence for and against impeaching Trump**. Democratic and Republican lawyers will argue their respective cases and present evidence from the House Intelligence Committee's report on Trump's attempts to pressure Ukraine to open investigations into his political rivals. "The central allegation," said Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, "is that the president put himself above his country several times, that he sought foreign interference in our elections several times, both for 2016 and 2020, that he sought to cover it up." Nadler said the committee could vote as early as this week on at least two or more articles of impeachment against Trump.

1. **Sen. Lindsey Graham said he doesn't plan to call House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff as a witness in the Senate impeachment trial**. Graham said he doesn't want to participate in things he thinks "will destroy the country," and warned Schiff against calling other Republican members of Congress to testify. Graham also said he plans to seek a quick end to the impeachment trial if it reaches the Senate, declaring that once a simple majority of senators "say we've had enough, the trial is going to end."

AG William Barr recently approved the release of new details about Christopher Steele in a forthcoming report about the Mueller probe from DOJ inspector general Michael Horowitz. Steele was not given any additional details about which information the DOJ plans to release, nor was he told how the information would affect the report's portrayal of him. The IG report is expected to be released today. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/09/us/politics/ig-report-steele-dossier.html))

4. **The U.S. ambassador to Denmark prevented a NATO expert from speaking at an international conference hosted by the U.S. embassy because the expert has been critical of Trump**. Stanley Sloan was scheduled to give the keynote speech at a conference about the history and future of NATO, but he was told the day before he was set to leave for Copenhagen that the embassy had vetoed his participation. As a result, the think tank that was cohosting the event with the American embassy decided to cancel the conference altogether.
