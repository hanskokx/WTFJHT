1. **The Department of the Interior spent almost $139,000 on new doors for Secretary Ryan Zinke's office.** Zinke was apparently unaware of the expenditure until someone from the Associated Press reached out to him to confirm the reports. According to a spokesperson for Zinke, the doors to his office required a security upgrade because they would not lock.

2. **Trump has accepted North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's invitation to meet for negotiations over his country's nuclear weapons program.** The two world leaders are expected to meet at some point during the next two months. Trump also said that North Korea has agreed to cease all missile testing while the negotiations are ongoing. The news of the potential meeting has reportedly been met with positive reactions from officials in China, Russia and South Korea, three of the major players that are also involved in resolving the ongoing standoff between the U.S. and North Korea.

4. **The Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs is fighting to maintain his standing and fend off a mutiny inside the department.** David Shulkin, who leads the second-largest bureaucracy in the government, no longer holds morning meetings with Trump's political appointees, and instead holds meetings with only his senior management team. Shulkin and his public-affairs chief also haven't spoken in weeks â€“ and an armed guard has been assigned to stand watch outside of his office.
