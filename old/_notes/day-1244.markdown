1. **The FDA will no longer authorize the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine to treat COVID-19 because they "are unlikely to produce an antiviral effect,"** according to the FDA's chief scientist. The acting director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority was the one who requested that the agency revoke the authorizations for the drugs. Doctors still have the option to prescribe hydroxychloroquine as an "off label" treatment for coronavirus because the drug is approved for other uses, and clinical trials will also be allowed to continue.

2. **Trump and Pence downplayed the latest spikes in COVID-19 cases in states across the country and misleadingly attributed the rise in new cases to increases in testing.** On a private call with governors, Pence urged them to "make sure and continue to explain to your citizens the magnitude of increase in testing" and said that "in most of the cases where we are seeing some marginal rise in number, that’s more a result of the extraordinary work you’re doing." In reality, experts have warned that seven-day averages have increased since May 31 in several states with coronavirus outbreaks, and positive cases in at least 14 states have outpaced the average number of tests that have been administered. Trump also downplayed the rise of new cases across the country, suggesting during a White House event for seniors that if the United States "stopped testing right now, we’d have very few cases, if any."

3. **Trump plans to sign an executive order on police reform today. Trump told reporters that the order will be "pretty comprehensive."** He said the order will cover "things that we’ve been watching and seeing for the last month," adding that "we’re going to have some solutions, some good solutions." Senior administrative officials said the order is aimed at implementing new funding incentives for police departments to improve their practices, including retention and recruitment. The order is also expected to encourage communities to prioritize "co-respondent services" that work more closely with social workers when responding to certain nonviolent calls that involving mental health, drug addiction and homelessness issues instead of just sending police to the scene.

4. **Trump-appointed Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion for the court's recent landmark civil rights decision that protects gay and transgender people from workplace discrimination**. Gorsuch was Trump's first appointment to the court; his seat was held vacant by Mitch McConnell until Obama left office after Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016. Gorsuch joined the court’s four liberal justices and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. in 6-to-3 majority declaring that gay and transgender workers are protected by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race, religion, national origin and sex.
