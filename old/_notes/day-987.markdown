1. **Trump told aides last year he wanted U.S. forces with bayonets to block people from crossing into the United States across the Mexico border**. He also suggested the excavation of a border trench, or moat, that could be stocked with dangerous reptiles. The New York Times reported on Trump’s proposal for a moat filled with snakes and alligators, along with his suggestion that U.S. forces could open fire on migrants as they attempted to enter the country, which Trump denied on Twitter yesterday. The Washington Post independently confirmed that the president did, in fact, say those things during border security meetings, including when he demanded the wholesale closure of the Mexico border and appeared prepared to enforce the decree with violence.

2. **Ukraine’s former President Petro Poroshenko said Biden never asked him to open or close any criminal cases**. Poroshenko refuted Trump’s claims that Biden abused his power to pressure Kiev to dismiss a federal prosecutor who was investigating a natural gas company of which Biden's son was a board member. "The former vice president, at least in personal conversations, didn’t raise any requests to open or close any concrete cases," Poroshenko said.

3. **The U.S. announced new tariffs on European goods in retaliation for illegal airplane subsidies from the European Union**. The goods include 10% tariffs on Airbus planes and 25% duties on French wine, Scotch and Irish whiskies, and cheese from across the continent. The announcement came after the World Trade Organization gave Washington a green light to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of EU goods annually, a move that threatens to set off a tit-for-tat trade war between the U.S. and the EU. The tariffs are set to go into effect on Oct. 18. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wto-aircraft-idUSKBN1WH0SI))
