1. **The House committees in charge of the Trump impeachment inquiry plan subpoenaed acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney for testimony**. House investigators want Mulvaney to testify this morning. Mulvaney is now the highest-ranking White House official to be subpoenaed to testify as part of the impeachment inquiry. The committees first subpoenaed Mulvaney for documents in October, but now they want to hear from him directly about his role in the Trump administration's decision to withhold nearly $400 million in U.S. security aid to Ukraine. Mulvaney is not expected to comply with the subpoena.

2. **An attorney for the whistleblower whose complaint is at the center of the impeachment inquiry has issued a "cease and desist" letter to the White House over Trump's attacks against the whistleblower**. The letter from Andrew Bakaj to White House counsel Pat Cipollone says Bakaj is worried that the White House "is engaging in rhetoric and activity that places my client, the Intelligence Community Whistleblower, and their family in physical danger." Trump has repeatedly attacked the credibility of the whistleblower, demanded to "meet his accuser," and called for the identify of the whistleblower to be revealed publicly.
