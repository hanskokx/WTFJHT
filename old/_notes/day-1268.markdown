1. **Mark Esper confirmed that he had been briefed earlier this year on information regarding a Russian bounty program aimed at paying Taliban fighters to kill U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan.** The Secretary of Defense also said, however, that he has not seen intelligence that corroborates claims that American troops were actually killed as a result of the payments. Esper made the comments before he appeared in front of the House Armed Services Committee alongside Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army Gen. Mark Milley, during which the two answered questions about their knowledge of the intelligence surrounding the Russian bounty program. Esper told lawmakers that he had seen intelligence about Russian payments in February, but added that his top generals did not believe those initial reports were credible at the time. Esper and Milley assured the committee that the military is "going to get to the bottom of all that," adding that the protection of U.S. forces is "the number one priority for every one of us."

2. **The Department of Homeland Security has been deploying its resources and agents to guard monuments and statues across the country.** The DHS was originally created in the wake of Sept. 11, 2001 and was tasked with guarding the U.S. against terrorism, and Trump initially repurposed the agency when he first took office to focus on illegal immigration and border security. Now, it is increasingly focused on protecting statues. "American ideals are under attack," said a DHS spokesperson. "President Trump is taking strong action to restore order. Acting Secretary Wolf is committed to using all DHS authorities and resources to implement President Trumpâ€™s agenda."

3. **Trump implied that he's ready to grant clemency to Roger Stone.** In a pair of interviews, Trump said he'll be watching Stone's case and suggested that he may pardon Stone. "He was framed. He was treated horrible. He was treated so badly," Trump added. Stone is a friend and ally of Trump who was convicted of seven felonies for obstructing the congressional inquiry, lying to investigators under oath and trying to block the testimony of a witness whose account would have exposed his lies. He is set to go to prison this month. When told that Stone was "praying" for a pardon ahead of his deadline to report to prison, Trump said, "If you say he's praying, his prayer may be answered," adding, "Let's see what happens."
