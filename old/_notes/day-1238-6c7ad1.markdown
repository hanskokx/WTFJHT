1. **Trump will hold a campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma on June 19, his first since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.** The campaign is not expected to implement any social distancing measures or compel attendees to wear masks because Trump thinks it's unnecessary and has made it clear he doesn't want it to look like he's speaking in front of a crowd that looks empty. "They’ve done a great job with COVID, as you know, the state of Oklahoma," Trump said. Trump said he also plans to hold rallies in Florida, Arizona and North Carolina.

2. **Trump threatened via Twitter to have the federal government intervene in Seattle if Mayor Jenny Durkan refused to "Take back your city NOW" from local protesters.** "If you don’t do it, I will," he tweeted. "This is not a game." Trump also warned that "Domestic Terrorists" who he claimed were "run by Radical Left Democrats" had taken over the city, adding, "LAW & ORDER!" In Seattle, city leaders had closed the Capitol Hill police station and allowed demonstrations to continue without police presence, which took the form of discussions about priorities, speeches and poetry readings, and children drawing on the street with chalk. There were no incidents of violence or looting. The Seattle fire chief spent the night walking through the crowds and talking with protesters about their needs.
