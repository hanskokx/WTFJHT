1. **Trump called for "strong background checks" in the wake of the two mass shootings in El Paso, TX and Dayton, OH over the weekend**, which left 29 people dead. In a series of tweets, Trump also suggested "perhaps marrying this legislation with desperately needed immigration reform." Trump's tweets were posted three hours ahead of prepared remarks today at the White House about the mass shootings. Congress is adjourned on summer recess and lawmakers are not scheduled to return until September.

2. **Trump dismissed accusations that his own racist and anti-immigrant rhetoric has stoked racial hatred and helped to provoke would-be mass shooters**. On Twitter, Trump instead criticized the news media for contributing "greatly to the anger and rage that has built up over many years." The manifesto of the Walmart shooter in Texas, however, echoes the same kind of anti-immigrant language that Trump has used at his rallies over the years, specifically stating that "this attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas."

3. **A Republican lawmaker in Nebraska said Trump and the GOP are "enabling white supremacy."** Rep. John McCollister said that while he is "not suggesting that all Republicans are white supremacists," nor that the average Republican voter is a racist, "the Republican Party is COMPLICIT to obvious racist and immoral activity inside our party." McCollister continued by directly calling out Trump, who has downplayed the threat of white supremacy and white nationalism: "We have a Republican president who continually stokes racist fears in his base," McCollister tweeted. "He calls certain countries ‘sh\*tholes,’ tells women of color to ‘go back’ to where they came from and lies more than he tells the truth."

4. **FBI Director Christopher Wray ordered the agency's offices across the country to conduct a new threat assessment in order to identify and stop potential future mass shootings**. A command group in Washington, D.C. will oversee the effort, during which FBI field offices will actively work to identify threats that are similar to the attacks last week at a food festival and over the weekend in Texas and Ohio.
