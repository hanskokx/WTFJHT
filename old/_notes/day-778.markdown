1. **Manafort's 47 months in prison for bank and tax fraud was far lighter than the 19- to 24-year prison term recommended under federal sentencing guidelines**. Manafort was also ordered to pay a $50,000 fine and restitution of just over $24 million. Judge T. S. Ellis said he thought the sentencing recommendation was "excessive," adding that he believed Manafort "lived an otherwise blameless life." It's the longest sentence to date for a Trump associate caught up in Robert Mueller's investigation. Manafort will also be sentenced next week on separate charges that he served as an unregistered foreign agent, laundered money and tampered with a witness.

1. **Trump's inauguration fund took in tens of thousands of dollars from shell companies owned by foreign contributors and others with foreign ties.** Three shell companies each gave $25,000 to the fund. At least one contribution was made by a foreign national who is reportedly ineligible to make political donations under U.S. election law, which prohibits non-resident foreigners from contributing to political campaigns. One of the donations was made through a Delaware shell company on behalf of a wealthy Indian financier. Another was made by a shell company formed in Georgia on behalf of a lobbyist with ties to the Taiwanese government, and a New York-based shell company formed by an Israeli real estate developer made the third $25,000 donation.

2. **A White House source leaked documents related to Jared and Ivanka's security clearance to the House Oversight Committee.** The Trump administration refused to provide documents on the process for granting security clearances after the committee requested them, so a source inside the White House leaked them to the committee. One of the documents also includes details about why Jared's security clearance was changed to "interim" in September 2017.
