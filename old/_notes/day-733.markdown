1. **Giuliani walked back his comments about when the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations ended, saying his comments on Sunday were "hypothetical" and not meant to convey facts.** Giuliani originally said that the negotiations over the project continued up until the day Trump won, and that Trump remembered having "fleeting conversations" about the deal after the Trump Organization signed a letter of intent. "My recent statements," Guiliani said, "about discussions during the 2016 campaign between Michael Cohen and then-candidate Donald Trump about a potential Trump Moscow ‘project’ were hypothetical and not based on conversations I had with the president." At question is whether or not Trump was engaged in ongoing negotiations with an American adversary while also seeking the presidency. Giuliani later told the New Yorker that it didn't matter if Trump did engage in conversations with Russia about the Moscow deal, because it's not a crime to do so. "He didn’t have the conversations," Giuliani said. "Lawyers argue in the alternative. If we went to court, we would say we don’t have to prove whether it’s true or not true, because, even if it’s true, it’s not criminal."

2. **Donald Trump Jr. blamed Michael Cohen for the Trump Tower Moscow project. Trump Jr. said Cohen was solely responsible for the deal and that Trump Jr. and his family "don't know anything about it."** He went as far as to say it wasn't even a deal at all. "But the reality is this wasn't a deal — we don't know the developer. We don't know the site. We don't know anything about it." He continued: "Ultimately, it was Michael Cohen essentially trying to get a deal done. You know, he was there for a long time. He wasn't exactly a deal guy.  He didn’t bring too many to the table. So, I don't think anyone took it all that seriously." Trump Jr.'s statements contradict multiple facts about the deal that have already been made public.

3. **A U.S. banker with ties to the Kremlin tried to schedule a meeting with Trump nine days after he won the presidency in the hopes of securing a role in the Trump administration.** A producer from "The Apprentice" contacted one of Trump's closest advisers to set up a meeting with Robert Foresman, who is now chairman of the Swiss bank UBS's investment arm. Foresman lived in Moscow for years and led a $3 billion Russian investment firm and was touted as someone with connections to Putin's inner circle. Foresman did not end up getting a seat in Trump's administration, but he did manage to secure a sit-down meeting with Tom Barrack, then-chair of Trump's $100 million inaugural fund.

4. **The deal to lift sanctions against three companies controlled by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska appears to be much less punitive than advertised.** A binding confidential agreement signed by both sides contains provisions that would free Deripaska from hundred of millions of dollars in debt while also allowing him to maintain majority ownership over his most important company. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced last month that his department had reached a deal to lift the sanctions in exchange for a promise to "significantly diminish Deripaska’s ownership and sever his control." The confidential agreement, however, which was not released publicly, reveals much more information about the deal.

5. **A Russian singer linked to the Trump family canceled an upcoming tour of North America out of concerns over Robert Mueller's Russia probe.** Emin Agalarov is said to have helped to arrange the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya during the campaign. Agalarov said he canceled his upcoming tour "against his will" due to "circumstances beyond \[his\] control." Agalarov's attorney confirmed that the cancellation is "most definitely" linked to Mueller's probe. "He could come and do the concert but we don't want him to be subpoenaed or held under a material witness warrant or anything else," the attorney said.

6. **One in 10 TSA employees called out of work on Sunday as the government shutdown enters its fifth week**, with many TSA workers citing "financial limitations" as the reason for taking the day off. The TSA issued a statement saying that the agency "experienced a national rate of 10 percent of unscheduled absences compared to a 3.1 percent rate one year ago on the same day."

7. **Trump tweeted his support for the Covington Catholic High School kids** involved in a confrontation with Native Americans and Black Hebrew Israelites in front of the Lincoln Memorial last week. "Looking like Nick Sandman & Covington Catholic students were treated unfairly with early judgements proving out to be false - smeared by media," Trump tweeted. "Not good, but making big comeback!"

8. **Trump's official Facebook and Instagram accounts have been posting altered photos that make his torso look thinner and his hands look bigger.** At least three different photos appear to have been doctored to make Trump look more fit. Trump's hair and shoulders have been touched up, as well as his fingers, which were made slightly longer.
