1. **The Senate will stop confirming Trump's judicial nominations until the coronavirus pandemic has subsided**. A total of 38 lifetime judicial appointments are currently awaiting confirmation hearings in the Senate. Senate Republicans have been confirming Trump's nominees at a rapid-fire pace, and they plan to resume confirmations as soon as they return to Capitol Hill and resume their regular legislative schedule. "If we’re not there, it’s hard to push them through," said Senate Majority Whip John Thune. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/13/senate-trump-judges-coronavirus-175188))

2. **Dr. Anthony Fauci said the U.S. "obviously" could have saved more lives if efforts to stop the spread of the coronavirus began earlier, but officials faced "a lot of pushback about shutting things down."** Fauci added that if things were shut down "right from the very beginning, it may have been a little bit different." Later that day, Trump began retweeting posts calling for Fauci to be fired. Trump also reportedly spent the weekend calling people close to him and asking them, "What do you think of Fauci?"

3. **The names of the businesses that will receive hundreds of billions of dollars in federal coronavirus relief funding may not be disclosed publicly because of the way the relief bill was written**. The bill requires the names of some federal aid recipients to be published, but the CARES Act does not compel the Small Business Administration to disclose the identities of the companies that receive money from the $349 billion small business relief package. So far, the SBA has received around 487,000 applications for a total of $125 billion in funding requests.

4. **The Trump administration wants to cut wages for migrant workers in order to make it easier for the farming industry to cope with the economic impacts of the coronavirus**. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows has been working with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue on a policy that would reduce pay for people who are in the country under the H-2A seasonal guest-worker program. H-2A workers make up about 10 percent of farm laborers in the U.S. One way the Trump administration might accomplish this is to change a specific rule that requires farmers to pay their laborers a comparable rate to local hourly pay laws, a rule which Perdue has said is "kind of pricing ourselves out of business."
