1. **Two White House cafeterias were closed and contact tracing has been initiated after an employee tested positive for COVID-19.** The cafeterias are in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and the New Executive Office Building, which are part of the White House complex located next to the West Wing. It is not clear if the employee who tested positive was a cafeteria worker. The White House did not say what kind of symptoms the employee showed. White House employees were notified in an email and were told there was no need for them to self-quarantine, but they were advised to monitor themselves for symptoms of the virus and to stay home if they felt sick.

2. **Republicans are considering extending enhanced unemployment benefits at a reduced rate through the rest of the year instead of letting the program expire completely at the end of the month.** GOP lawmakers have not made a final decision on unemployment insurance in the bill they are set to released this week, but some are considering dropping the payments from $600 per week to $100 per week. Congress approved the additional $600-per-week benefit in March and Democrats want to maintain the program in its current state until at least next year. The U.S. unemployment rate is currently above 11%. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/22/coronavirus-stimulus-republicans-consider-unemployment-insurance-extension.html))

3. **The mayor of Portland, OR was tear gassed by federal agents outside of a federal courthouse during a protest against the presence of federal agents in the city.** Mayor Ted Wheeler was standing at the front of a crowd of demonstrators outside of the Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse when police fired tear gas and stun grenades into the crowd. It is unclear whether the federal agents knew Wheeler was in the crowd when they used the tear gas. "I’m not going to lie — it stings; it’s hard to breathe," Wheeler said. "And I can tell you with 100 percent honesty, I saw nothing which provoked this response."
