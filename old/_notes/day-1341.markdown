1. **Trump plans to name his pick to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg by the end of the week.** Trump told "Fox and Friends" that he has narrowed his list of potential nominees down to five people, who he is looking at "very seriously." "I will announce it either Friday or Saturday and then the work begins," he said. Trump added that he wants the new justice confirmed before the November election. It is unclear whether Republicans will have the votes necessary to confirm a new justice before the election. Two GOP senators, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, said they don't support voting on a new nominee before voters get a chance to decide whether Trump gets a second term. Democrats need two more Republicans to defect in order to prevent a confirmation.

* **Judge Amy Coney Barrett is considered to be the leading contender to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.** If Judge Barrett were nominated and confirmed, she would be the sitting justice with the least courtroom experience, but one viewed as a home run by conservative Christians and anti-abortion activists.

2. **More than half of U.S. states are reporting a rise in coronavirus cases.** 27 states and Puerto Rico all have test positivity rates above the 5% threshold that the World Health Organization recommends should hold steady for at least two weeks before businesses reopen. The test positivity rate is the percentage of all tests given that come back positive for coronavirus. Some states are seeing improvements, with Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts and New York all reporting positivity rates below 1%.

3. **The USPS saw a severe decline in the rate of on-time delivery for first-class mail after Louis DeJoy took over as postmaster general in June.** According to new data obtained by The Guardian, the changes implemented by DeJoy shortly after he took over led to significant reductions in the amount of first-class mail that was delivered on time, starting the day after DeJoy's new policies were announced and implemented. The reductions in on-time deliveries and delivery speeds persisted even after DeJoy announced in August that he would suspend the changes until after the election.
