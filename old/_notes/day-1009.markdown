1. **A federal judge held Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in contempt for violating an order to stop collecting loans from former students at a defunct for-profit college**. Judge Sallie Kim of the U.S. District Court in San Francisco fined the Education Department $100,000 for violating a preliminary injunction against collecting loans from former students at Corinthian College. Money from the fine will be used to compensate the 16,000 people harmed by the Department of Education's actions, which includes garnishing former students' paychecks and seizing their tax returns. The Trump administration was forced to admit earlier this year that it erroneously collected loans from thousands of former Corinthian students despite being ordered to stop doing so.

2. **William Barr's administrative review of the origins of the Russia probe is now a criminal investigation**. The review is being conducted by Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham, and it has shifted from an administrative review of the Russia investigation closely overseen by Barr to a criminal inquiry. The shift gives Durham the power to issue subpoenas for witness testimony and documents, to convene a grand jury, and to file criminal charges. Trump has repeatedly attacked the Russia investigation, portraying it as a hoax and illegal operation conducted by an illegitimate special counsel.

3. **A top Russia and Europe adviser on Trump's National Security Council is expected to testify before House impeachment investigators next week**. Tim Morrison is expected to corroborate Bill Taylor's testimony that Trump was pressing for Ukraine to publicly announce investigations into the Bidens in exchange for U.S. security assistance. Morrison is a current White House official whose name was cited 15 times in Taylor's opening statement on Tuesday, and he was also listening in on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian president Zelensky. Morrison is also expected to say that he didn't see anything wrong with what the Trump administration did with regard to Ukraine.

* **Read the Trump administration’s warning letter to Laura Cooper**.

One such witness, Laura Cooper, a Pentagon official, received a warning letter that shows how the administration has attempted to persuade officials to keep silent.
