1. **Trump warned that "people will not stand for it" if Robert Mueller's report makes him look bad**. Trump complained that "a deputy, that didn’t get any votes, appoints a man that didn’t get any votes," referring to Rod Rosenstein. "I have a deputy," he continued, "appoints a man to write a report on me, to make a determination on my presidency? People will not stand for it." No one knows when the Mueller report on Russian interference and possible collusion will be released, but reporters have been staking out Mueller's office all morning.

2. **Trump called on Attorney General William Barr to "do what's fair" and open investigations into Hillary Clinton, James Comey, former intelligence chief James Clapper, and former CIA director James Brennan.** Trump complained in an interview that he'd been treated "very unfairly" by Mueller's team, while "nobody does anything" about all the "stone cold crimes" committed by former Obama officials. Trump also accused Comey, Clapper, and Brennan of telling "absolute lies" to Congress without providing any proof or specifics for his claims.

3. **The commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps warned that sending troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and funding transfers under Trump's emergency declaration has posed "unacceptable risk to Marine Corps combat readiness and solvency."** Marine Corps Gen. Robert Neller wrote two internal memos that said the "unplanned/unbudgeted" deployment order by Trump last fall along the southwest border, along with shifts in other funds to support border security operations, have forced him to cancel or reduce other military training in at least five countries and delay urgent base repairs.

4. **The deputy director of the National Economic Council is planning to leave the White House in the coming weeks as the Trump administration continues its high-stakes talks with China.** Clete Willems is expected to leave his position in April due to the strain that frequent travel has placed on his young and growing family, according to people familiar with his plans to leave. A replacement to fill the top White House trade position is still in the works, but nothing has been finalized.
