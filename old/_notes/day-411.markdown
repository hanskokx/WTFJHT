1. **Sam Nunberg now says he'll probably cooperate with Mueller's subpoena after all.** After appearing on multiple cable news programs yesterday to announce his plans to defy the special prosecutor's demands, the former Trump aide conceded that he'll likely find a way to comply with the requests. “I’m going to end up cooperating with them,” Nunberg said.

2. **South Korean president Moon Jae-in says North Korean leader Kim Jong-un may be ready to begin negotiations with the U.S. on abandoning its nuclear arsenal** and suspending all nuclear and missile tests while the negotiations are in progress. The move, if confirmed by North Korean officials, would mark the first time North Korea has been willing to discuss surrendering their nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees from the United States.

3. **Trump doubled down on his threats to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, but the White House is also trying to find ways to mitigate the impact of the proposed tariffs on major U.S. trading partners.** Trump said he would be willing to consider a compromise with Mexico and Canada and make them exempt from the tariffs if the two countries agreed to renegotiate NAFTA. The latest maneuvering by the White House is likely to delay any formal implementation of the proposed tariffs, which are set to begin next week.

4. **Michael Flynn is selling his house to pay for his mounting legal bills after pleading guilty last year to lying to the FBI.** The house went on the market in December and is listed at $895,000. Flynn's brother, Joe, says Flynn will use the money to pay for high legal defense debts. ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/US/flynn-selling-house-pay-legal-bills-trump-probe/story?id=53545172))

5. **The Trump administration will no longer use the 2017 Endangered Species Act to prevent people from importing elephant trophies from Africa**, contrary to Trump's previous promises to maintain the Obama-era protections. The Fish and Wildlife Service issued a formal memorandum last week, which said "the findings are no longer effective for making individual permit determinations for imports of sport-hunted African elephant trophies."
