1. **Mitch McConnell blocked a second resolution in the Senate that called for Mueller's report to be made public.** Senate Judiciary Chair Diane Feinstein tried to get unanimous consent to pass a Senate version of a non-binding resolution that passed in the House with a vote of 420-0. McConnell objected to her request and said that AG William Barr is still working with Mueller to determine which parts of the report, if any, should be made public. "I have consistently supported the proposition that his report ought to be released to the greatest extent possible, consistent with the law," McConnell said. "I think we should be consistent in letting the special counsel actually finish his work and not just when we think it may be politically advantageous to one side or the other."

2. **Former Trump campaign adviser and convicted felon George Papadopoulos said his legal team is pursuing a presidential pardon in order to clear his name.** "There's been so much disinformation and misunderstanding about who George Papadopoulos is," Papadopoulos said. "So I am simply getting the facts out there for the public to consume," he continued, "for the media to consume and then for them to articulate something completely different than has been said about me for the past two years." Papadopoulos lied to the FBI about his ties to Russia and plead guilty in 2017, but in his new book he claims he actually didn't lie to the FBI, he simply caved and signed a plea deal in response to pressure from Mueller's investigators.

3. **House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff doubled down on his claims that he has seen evidence that Trump colluded with Russia.** "Undoubtedly there is collusion," Schiff said during an interview. "We will continue to investigate the counterintelligence issues. That is, is the president or people around him compromised in any way by a hostile foreign power? . . . It doesn’t appear that was any part of Mueller’s report." House Democrats gave William Barr until April 2 to deliver a copy of the Mueller report to Congress.

4. **Betsy DeVos struggled to defend her decision to eliminate all $18 million in federal funding for the Special Olympics during a congressional subcommittee meeting.** Members of a House Appropriations subcommittee pushed DeVos on her proposed cuts to the Special Olympics, as well as other special education plans. When asked if she knew how many children would be affected by her plan, DeVos could not provide an answer. "I think that the Special Olympics is an awesome organization," DeVos responded, "one that is well supported by the philanthropic sector as well." The proposed education budget includes roughly $2 billion in cuts to Pell Grants, plus billions of dollars in reductions to about 30 other programs.
