1. **Mike Pence is hosting a fundraiser for Congressional Republicans on an island in Florida.** It costs $2,500 to attend, $5,000 for a picture with Pence, and $25,000 to have dinner with him. The event will be held at the waterfront home of U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, a Republican who served with Pence in Congress. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he will meet with Pence in Palm Beach before the event to discuss coronavirus response coordination.

2. **Global stocks fell again as fears about the impact of the coronavirus continue to spread.** Germany's DAX fell by 5% before leveling out again, while Tokyo and Shanghai closed at a 3.7% loss. The S&P 500 is on track for the market’s worst week since the 2008 financial crisis. Major companies in China are now issuing profit warnings, saying factory shutdowns inside the country are disrupting supply chains. Travel bans and other anti-disease measures are also reportedly hurting sales in China.

3. **Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney accused the press of peddling false narratives about the administration "scrambling" to deal with the coronavirus.** Mulvaney claimed that he briefed Congress six weeks ago and accused the media of ignoring the story until very recently, focusing instead on Trump's "hoax" impeachment. "Why didn’t you hear about it?" Mulvaney asked the crowd at CPAC. "The press was covering their hoax of the day because they thought it would bring down the president." He added: "Are you going to see some schools shut down? Probably. May you see impacts on public transportation? Sure. \[But\] we know how to handle this."
