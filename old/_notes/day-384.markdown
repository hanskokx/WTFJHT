1. **Trump's allies are calling for a compromise when it comes to the president's interview with Mueller.** They don't want Trump to sit down and speak freely with Mueller, but they also want to avoid a standoff that could make its way to the Supreme Court if neither side balks. Trump's legal team is still exploring the possibility of a written exchange with Mueller. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/07/trump-mueller-russia-probe-395958))

2. **Trump still wants to talk to Mueller despite the concerns of his associates, partly because he believes he is completely innocent.** Trump apparently also believes that his experience with lawsuits and testifying under oath during his time as a real estate mogul will allow him to get through his interview with Mueller unscathed.

3. **Democrats flipped a Missouri state House of Representatives seat that went for Trump by a 61-33 margin in 2016.** Mike Revis, a 27-year-old Democrat, managed to beat out Republic David Linton by 108 votes, or about 3 percent of the vote.

4. **Democrats are contemplating a post-Pelosi party**, assuming she decides to either leave of her own volition or is pressured to step down in the wake of a failed bid to take back the Congress the midterms. Pelosi's departure would likely trigger "an intraparty war," according to Rep. Alcee Hastings. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/06/nancy-pelosi-house-democrats-395924))

5. **Top leaders in the Senate are working to finalize a long-term budget deal** that would include a boost in both defense and domestic spending. The House already passed a short-term spending measure aimed at keeping the government open through the weekend and avoid a second shutdown, but party leaders in the Senate say a breakthrough on a two-year budget deal is within their grasp.

6. **Rex Tillerson says Russia is already trying to influence the 2018 midterm election.** Tillerson warned that Russia has "a lot of different tools" that it can use to influence the election. He added: "I don't know that I would say we are better prepared, because the Russians will adapt, as well. The point is, if it's their intention to interfere, they are going to find ways to do that."
