1. **The North Korean delegation to the Trump-Kim summit called a rare press conference in the middle of the night to dispute Trump's claim that Kim demanded that the U.S. lift all sanctions in order for North Korea to move forward with denuclearization.** "Basically," Trump said yesterday, "they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety, and we couldnâ€™t do that. We had to walk away from that." Hours later, two top officials from the North Korean delegation told reporters Kim had only asked for partial sanctions relief in exchange for shutting down their main nuclear complex. An anonymous senior U.S. official acknowledged that Kim only wanted the U.N. Security Council to lift the sanctions imposed since March 2016, and did not include sanctions from the previous decade.

2. **Trump reiterated his plans to veto the House-passed resolution that would end his national emergency declaration.** "We'll be fine," Trump told Sean Hannity. When Hannity suggested that Trump would veto the resolution and that Congres would not be able to overturn the veto, Trump said, "Yeah." The Senate is required to vote on the House-passed measure within 18 days of its passage, and only four GOP senators need to vote with the Democrats in order for it to pass. Three Republicans have already indicated that they will back the resolution.

3. **U.S. Customs and Border Patrol data show more undocumented immigrants are choosing to cross the border illegally instead of waiting in line to claim asylum at legal U.S. ports of entry** as a result of the Trump administration's policies at the southern border. As CBP has cracked down on the number of migrants who can be processed at ports of entry, the number of migrants caught crossing illegally has gone up by 10 percent over the same period since last year.

4. **Three high-profile immigrant rights organizations sent a joint letter to DHS accusing ICE of detaining an "alarming" number of infants at a Texas detention center without providing the legally-required level of care.** The letter claims that at least nine infants younger than a year old are being held in ICE custody at the South Texas Family Residential Center. One of the infants is alleged to have been detained for more than 20 days. The letter also expressed "grave concern" about the lack of specialized medical care available to families who are being held at the facility.
