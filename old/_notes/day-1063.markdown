1. **The full House will convene to openly debate and vote on two articles of impeachment against Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress**. After an hour of debate over the "rule" governing the proceedings, lawmakers from both parties will spend six hours debating the actual articles of impeachment and whether to approve or reject them.
