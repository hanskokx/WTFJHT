1. **Former deputy Trump campaign chairman Rick Gates is scheduled to be sentenced today**. Gates cooperated extensively with the government after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI and conspiracy against the United States in February 2018, and is hoping he won't be sentenced to prison in exchange for the "extraordinary assistance" he provided to prosecutors. Federal sentencing guidelines recommend that Gates serve 46 to 57 months in prison, but the guidelines are not mandatory. U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson in D.C. will decide Gates' punishment.

2. **A Rudy Giuliani associate is expected to appear in court today and could face jail time for allegedly concealing a $1 million payment from Russia before his initial arrest**. Lev Parnas is charged with violating campaign finance laws and has been living under house arrest in Florida since October. Prosecutors also say Parnas and another Florida businessman named Igor Fruman illegally funneled money into a pro-Trump election committee and to other politician. Parnas denies hiding the payment and both have pleaded not guilty. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-giuliani-parnas-idUSKBN1YL162))

3. **Giuliani admitted in an interview that he told Trump "a couple of times" that then-ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was impeding efforts that could benefit Trump politically, leading to Yovanovitch's ouster**. Giuliani told Trump that Yovanovitch was getting in the way of investigations into Biden and his son, as well as the debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential election. Trump then put Giuliani in touch with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who asked for more details, and Yovanovitch was eventually recalled from her position weeks later and was told that Trump had lost trust in her.

4. **House Democrats and Republicans will meet today to hash out the rules of engagement for a vote on impeachment**.

Lawmakers are also expected to offer amendments at the meeting, which could last up to 12 hours depending on how many of the 431 sitting representatives decide to attend and speak.

John Kasich adviser John Weaver, former New Hampshire GOP chair Jennifer Horn, veteran Republican operative Rick Wilson, and George Conway, a conservative attorney and husband of Trump’s chief counselor Kellyanne Conway. The group has reportedly raised more than $1 million so far to support their official mission, which is to "Defeat President Trump and Trumpism at the ballot box."
