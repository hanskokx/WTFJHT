1. **Two more suspicious packages, addressed to Sen. Cory Booker and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, have been intercepted.** Booker's package was addressed to his office in Camden, NJ, while Clapper's was addressed to CNN's New York offices. Booker's was discovered in Florida and Clapper's was found at a New York City postal facility. Law enforcement officials are treating the bombs as a matter of domestic terrorism.

2. **The Trump administration will dispatch at least 800 active duty troops to the southern border.** Secretary of Defense James Mattis is expected to sign an order to direct the U.S. military to the border to support the National Guard forces already in place. DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is expected to address the move at a press conference later today.

3. **The Trump administration admitted that it failed to account for at least 14 migrant children who were separated from their families at the southern border.** The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement told a federal court that it separated 2,668 children from their parents instead of 2,654. The latest HHS filing said it "recently completed another review of case management records to ensure that its characterization of certain children in ORR care remain accurate."

4. **The Trump administration is considering an executive order similar to the Muslim ban in order to block certain Central and South American asylum seekers from entering the country via the southern border.** The proposed order has not been finalized and is currently in the formative stages. If approved, the order would mark a significant escalation in border enforcement policy.
