1. **Trump refused to say whether he will accept the results of the 2020 presidential election if he loses to Joe Biden.** When asked by Fox News' Chris Wallace whether he was a "good loser," Trump said, "I'm not a good loser. I don't like to lose." Trump then said he thinks that mail-in voting is going to "rig the election." Wallace then asked, "Are you suggesting that you might not accept the results of the election?" Trump responded: "I have to see. I'm not just going to say yes. I'm not going to say no." Trump then claimed that Hillary Clinton is "the one who never accepted the loss."

2. **Trump insisted that he'll "be right eventually" when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic, claiming that "It's going to disappear."** Trump also called Dr. Anthony Fauci's statements about the virus "alarmist," even as the U.S. death toll passes the 140,000 mark. Trump also insisted that the U.S. has the lowest coronavirus mortality rate in the world, which is not true. The US has the seventh-worst coronavirus mortality rate, trailing countries like Russia and Brazil.

3. **Trump accused Fox News' Chris Wallace of misrepresenting the difficulty of a cognitive test Trump took as part of a medical examination.** "The first two questions are easy," Trump said, "but I bet you couldn't even answer the last five questions. They get very hard." Wallace pointed out that "it's not the hardest test. They have a picture and it says 'whatâ€™s that' and it's an elephant." Trump then pushed back: "No, no, no. ... You see, that's all misrepresentation." When asked to describe the questions that Trump felt were "very hard," Trump said "I'll get you the test," and challenged Joe Biden to "take the same test that I took," claiming that "Joe Biden could not answer those questions."
