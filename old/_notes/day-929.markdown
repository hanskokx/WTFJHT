1. **A federal judge signaled that he is considering removing the redactions in the Mueller report**. District Judge Reggie Walton appeared to side several times with attorneys for BuzzFeed and the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center during oral arguments in a case seeking to remove the redaction of nearly 1,000 items in Mueller's final report. The case includes a pair of consolidated lawsuits filed against the Justice Department under the Freedom of Information Act. "That’s what open government is about," Walton said during one exchange. Walton has the power to rule on the redactions, but he also has the power to review the unredacted report to see if the exemptions claimed by the DOJ to block the release of the full report actually comport with what is permitted under the law.

2. **The Trump campaign paid for more than 2,000 Facebook ads since January that included the word "invasion" in relation to immigration**. The campaign has spent roughly $1.25 million on Facebook ads about immigration since late March, a significant portion of the nearly $5.6 million the campaign spent on Facebook ads overall during that same period. "We have an INVASION!" many of the ads say in large letters. "It’s CRITICAL that we STOP THE INVASION." While there is no evidence that Trump's campaign messaging directly influenced the shooter in the white supremacist terrorist attack that left 22 people dead and dozens injured in El Paso, the shooter declared in his manifesto that "this attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas."

3. **Mitch McConnell's campaign tweeted a photo of mock tombstones bearing the names of McConnell's political opponents**, as well as Democratic proposals and nominees he has blocked. The tombstones include Amy McGrath, his Democratic opponent in the 2020 Kentucky Senate race, and Judge Merrick Garland, whose nomination to the Supreme Court he blocked during the last year of Obama’s second term. The graves also include the Green New Deal and "Socialism" generally. The tweet features a photo of the tombstones alongside a photo of McConnell with the caption, "The Grim Reaper of Socialism at #FancyFarm today."
