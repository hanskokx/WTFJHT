1. **Republicans in the Senate blocked an effort to pass a bill that would require campaigns to tell the FBI about any offers of foreign assistance they receive**. Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) called the legislation's reporting requirements "overbroad," and complained that it would require campaigns to worry about disclosures at "so many different levels." Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) said Blackburn's assessment of the bill was "not accurate," and said, "The only thing that would have to be reported is if the agent of a foreign government or national offered that something that was already prohibited."

* **FEC Chairwoman Ellen Weintraub**: "Let me make something 100% clear to the American public and anyone running for public office: It is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election. This is not a novel concept." ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/13/fec-election-foreign-trump-1364598))

1. **The owner of one of the Japanese oil tankers that was attacked in the Straight of Hormuz says the U.S. is wrong about the attack**, contradicting the claims made — without evidence — by Trump and Mike Pompeo. The U.S. military released a video and claimed that it shows Iranian boats retrieving an unexploded mine from the oil tanker, but the owner of the tanker says his sailors saw "flying objects" just before it was hit. Yutaka Katada called the reports claiming his tanker was hit by a mine "false" and denied any possibility of a mine or torpedo attack because "the impact was well above the water."

2. **Trump says he won't fire Kellyanne Conway over her repeated violations of the Hatch Act**, which prohibits federal employees from engaging in political activity in their official roles. "It looks to me like they’re trying to take away her right of free speech," Trump said, "and that’s just not fair." A report submitted to Trump by the Office of Special Counsel found that Conway violated the Hatch Act on multiple occasions by "disparaging Democratic presidential candidates while speaking in her official capacity during television interviews and on social media."
