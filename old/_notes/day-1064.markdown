1. **Nancy Pelosi won't commit to sending the two articles of impeachment against Trump to the Senate**. Senior Democratic aides said it was "very unlikely" that the House will send the articles to the Senate before January, effectively delaying the upcoming Senate impeachment trial. "We cannot name managers until we see what the process is on the Senate side," she said. "So far we havenâ€™t seen anything that looks fair to us." Sen. Mitch McConnell has bragged that he is working in close coordination with the White House to ensure that Trump is not removed from office.

3. **Trump mocked Rep. Debbie Dingell at a rally in Michigan and suggested that her late husband Rep. John Dingell might be "looking up" from hell**. "Debbie Dingell, that's a real beauty," he told the crowd. Trump said he gave Dingell's husband an "A-plus" funeral, for which she called to thank him: "She calls me up: 'It's the nicest thing that's ever happened. Thank you so much. John would be so thrilled. He's looking down. He'd be so thrilled." Trump continued: "Maybe he's looking up, I don't know. I don't know. Maybe. But let's assume he's looking down."
