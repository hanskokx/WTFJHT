1. **The House Intelligence Committee will circulate and review a report on Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations into his political rivals**. Lawmakers will be given 24 hours to review the report. The committee will then hold a vote on Tuesday evening to decide whether to pass the impeachment inquiry on to the Judiciary Committee, which will begin scheduled impeachment hearings on Wednesday. The Judiciary Committee will then consider and draft articles of impeachment in the coming weeks.

2. **Neither Trump nor White House attorneys will participate in the first impeachment hearing with the Judiciary Committee on Wednesday**. In a letter to Chairman Jerry Nadler, White House counsel Pat Cipollone cited a "complete lack of due process and fundamental fairness afforded the president" as the reason for Trump's refusal to participate in the hearing. Cipollone did not rule out the possibility that the White House would participate in future proceedings, but he indicated that Democrats would first have to make serious concessions for that to happen. The White House has until 5 p.m. on Friday to confirm whether or not Trump will offer a defense as part of the broader impeachment proceedings.

3. **Trump called for a cease-fire between the Taliban and U.S. forces in Afghanistan**. Trump said during an unannounced Thanksgiving visit with U.S. troops overseas that the Taliban "wants to make a deal" and that "we're saying it has to be a cease-fire." Trump claimed that he has made "tremendous progress" since he abruptly canceled his previous peace talks with the Taliban in September. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani indicated that a cease-fire wasn't in progress or even part of the discussion with U.S. negotiators. Western diplomats and Taliban leaders were also confused by Trump's remarks, since demanding a cease-fire would constitute a sizable shift in the U.S. position and would require additional concessions from the Taliban.

4. **The Trump administration invoked an obscure provision in the PATRIOT Act to indefinitely detain a Palestinian man even after he completed his initial prison sentence**. After serving 15 years in federal prison, Adham Amin Hassoun was taken into custody by ICE and detained in New York while he awaited deportation. No country would accept him, so his attorneys argued for his release on the grounds that his deportation was unlikely. But the Trump administration instead declared him a threat to national security under section 412 of the PATRIOT Act. Hassoun's case represents the first-ever use of the section to side-step a six-month immigration detention limit imposed by the Supreme Court in 2001.

5. **Google and YouTube have removed more than 300 Trump video ads from their platforms because the ads violated company policies**. Most of the ads were removed over the summer. The companies did not provide reasons for why each ad was removed, and the offending videos are not available for screening. The archive of political ads maintained by Google and YouTube also fails to provide any information about how long each ad was allowed to run before it was removed, how much each ad cost to run, or how many impressions it received.
