1. **The Trump administration rolled back safety rules for offshore drilling operations that were put in place after the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.** The change is meant to ease drilling restrictions in places like the Gulf, even though oil production reached a record 1.9 million barrels per day at the end of 2018. It also reduces the required frequency of safety tests for key equipment such as blowout preventers, the last-ditch safety defenses against massive spills and "gushers." The new rule will take effect in 60 days. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/02/offshore-drilling-rules-1404098))

2. **Trump said he probably won't allow former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify to Congress since McGahn was already interviewed by Mueller's team.** "I would say it’s done," Trump told Fox News. "I’ve had him testifying already for 30 hours." Trump said he is concerned that allowing McGahn to testify would open the doors for Congress to call other members of his administration to appear before committees.

3. **The California state Senate voted 27-10 on Thursday in favor to prevent candidates from appearing on the ballot unless they have publicly released five years of their tax returns.** California will also be one of the first states to hold primary elections for the 2020 race, a first in the state's history. If the bill becomes law and Trump does not release his tax returns, he may not be on the California primary ballot.
