1. **The Trump Organization planned to give Vladimir Putin a $50 million penthouse at the proposed Trump Tower Moscow as part of the negotiations surrounding the luxury real estate project.** Michael Cohen discussed the idea with a representative of Dmitry Peskov, who serves as Putin's press secretary. The plan fizzled when the project failed to materialize, and it is not clear whether Trump knew about the plan to give the penthouse to Putin.

2. **Investigators have publicly cast Trump as a central figure in Mueller's investigation into whether the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government during the 2016 campaign.** Trump even has his own legal code name: "Individual 1." Documents reveal that investigators have evidence that Trump was in close contact with his most trusted aides and advisers as they dealt with both Russia and WikiLeaks, as well as evidence that they tried to cover their tracks.

3. **Mueller is also bearing down on Roger Stone and his relationship with WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange.** Mueller is focusing on Stone's role as a potential go-between for the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks, which published thousands of DNC emails that were stolen by Russian intelligence officers. Mueller's team has evidence that Stone may have known in advance about the release of the emails, and investigators may also be looking into potential witness intimidation by Stone.

4. **Ivanka and Trump Jr. are coming under increased scrutiny for their roles in the proposed Trump Tower Moscow project.** Trump Jr. and Ivanka were involved in the project at some point before Jan. 2016, but it is still unclear how deeply they were involved or how long they worked on the project after that. It is also unclear whether or not they worked with Michael Cohen on the deal.
