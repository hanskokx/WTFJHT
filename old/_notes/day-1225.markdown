1. **The Trump administration will not release updated economic projections this summer**, which are expected to show the country in a severe economic downturn as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. White Officials are supposed to release a federal budget proposal every February, and they usually follow that up with a "mid-session review" in either July or August that includes updated projections on economic trends such as unemployment, inflation, and economic growth. No other administration has failed to provide economic forecasts in its mid-session review since at least the 1970s. "It gets them off the hook for having to say what the economic outlook looks like," said a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.

2. **A draft of Trump's executive order targeting social media companies was leaked to the press**. The draft specifically targets Facebook, Twitter, and Google, as well as a section of U.S. law that says tech platforms can't be held legally responsible for what their users post and gives them broad powers to police content on their sites. The draft order asks the FCC to reexamine whether altering or removing user content causes the platforms to forgo those protections afforded to them under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Trump is expected to formally sign the order today after Twitter recently labeled two of his tweets about mail-in voting as "potentially misleading."

3. **2.1 million more Americans filed for first-time unemployment benefits last week**, bringing the total number of unemployed in the U.S. to more than 40 million. This is the eighth week in a row that new jobless filings continued to fall from their peak of around 6.9 million.
