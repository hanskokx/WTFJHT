Adam Schiff says the panels leading the probe will send a report to the House Judiciary Committee after lawmakers come back from break on Dec. 3. The report will detail how the White House refused to cooperate with the inquiry and will argue that the refusal may warrant an additional article of impeachment against Trump. The committees are required to produce the report before the House can take a full vote to impeach Trump. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment-idUSKBN1XZ2CT))
