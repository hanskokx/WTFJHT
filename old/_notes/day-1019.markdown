1. **All four White House officials scheduled to give depositions today as part of the House's impeachment inquiry will not show up to testify**. National Security Council attorneys John Eisenberg and Michael Ellis, along with assistant to the president Robert Blair and Brian McCormick, associate director for natural resources, energy & science at the Office of Management and Budget, will not appear today. Eisenberg is refusing to testify due to executive privilege. Blair, Ellis, and McCormick aren't appearing because they won't be able to have an attorney from the administration present. Two other officials from the OMB, Michael Duffey and Russell Vought, will also skip their depositions later this week. Energy Secretary Rick Perry is also scheduled to appear for a closed door deposition on Wednesday, but he will not be participating either.

2. **One of Mick Mulvaney's top allies is attempting to rally other administration officials to collectively defy Congressional subpoenas** from Democrats involved in the House impeachment inquiry. Russel Vought, who leads the Office of Management and Budget, and two of his subordinates are attempting to demonstrate their loyalty to Trump while also creating a firewall around Trump's alleged use of foreign aid to obtain political favors from a U.S. ally. The OMB is at the center of the impeachment inquiry because Democrats want information about why the office effectively froze U.S. military aid to Ukraine even though Congress had already appropriated for that country.

3. **Paul Manafort started spreading one of the Ukraine conspiracy theories at the center of the House impeachment inquiry at least five months before the 2016 election**. Newly released documents from Robert Mueller's investigation show that shortly after the emails stolen from the Democrats were published in June 2016, Manafort told his deputy on the campaign that Ukraine, not Russia, was responsible for hacking the Democratic National Committee.

4. **Trump attacked California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Twitter and blamed him for the wildfires that are currently raging across the state**. Trump tweeted that Newsom has "done a terrible job of forest management," causing the string of recent fires. Later, he went after Adam Schiff. "Corrupt Adam," Trump tweeted, "should clean up & manage the California forests which are always burning!" Of the 33 million acres of forest in California, 57% is controlled by the federal government.
