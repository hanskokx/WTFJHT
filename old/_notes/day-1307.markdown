1. **Trump said he plans to seek a third term "because they spied on my campaign."** Trump's often-repeated claim that the Obama administration illegally spied on his campaign has been refuted by Trump's own FBI in a [detailed report](https://apnews.com/c6efe460414b401abb0e86f45099380f). Trump made the claim during a rally in Wisconsin last night. "We are going to win four more years," he told the crowd. "And then after that, we’ll go for another four years because they spied on my campaign. We should get a redo of four years." According to the 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, however, "No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice."

2. **Trump wanted to stop sending emergency relief funding to California in the middle of a series of devastating wildfires because it was a blue state**, according to a former DHS official. He also tried to deliberately separate families to deter immigration, said Miles Taylor, former chief of staff to former Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen. Taylor alleges that Trump asked for funding to be pulled from FEMA during the catastrophic 2019 wildfires that caused millions of dollars in damage in California, because the state was not part of his political base. "He told us to stop giving money to people whose houses had burned down because he was so rageful that people in the state of California didn’t support him," Taylor said. Taylor also claims Trump tried to reinstate the practice of separating children from their families at the border in order to scare immigrants, and that Trump became "visibly furious" when Nielsen refused to do so.

3. **Trump retweeted Russian propaganda about Joe Biden that the U.S. intelligence community says it part of Moscow's ongoing effort to "denigrate" Biden ahead of the election.** The tweet contained audiotapes of a 2016 conversation between Biden and then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. The material was released earlier this year by Andriy Derkach, a Ukrainian lawmaker named by the US intelligence community in its August 7 statement about Russia's disinformation campaign against Biden. There is no proof of wrongdoing on the tapes, but Trump and his allies, along with Kremlin-controlled media outlets, have used the tapes to foment conspiracies about Biden's dealings with Ukraine.

4. **The Trump campaign started selling face masks.** The campaign is also telling Trump's supporters that he "urges all patriotic Americans to wear a face cover when they are unable to socially distance." Trump initially refused to wear a face mask and called them a "double-edged sword." He also mocked Biden for wearing one in public in May. Mask use among Trump's base increased after Trump started wearing one. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/trump-campaign-2020-face-masks-b8bc4a17-b187-431b-aef6-d1777df2d36c.html))
