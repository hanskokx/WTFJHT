1. **Trump offered well-wishes to the accomplice of accused sex trafficker and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.** Trump was asked during a press conference whether he expected Ghislaine Maxwell to go public with the names of powerful men who have been accused in lawsuits of taking part in the sex-trafficking ring that Epstein allegedly ran. "I don’t know," Trump said. "I haven’t really been following it too much. I just wish her well, frankly." He continued: "I’ve met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach. But I wish her well, whatever it is." Maxwell is facing federal charges of helping Epstein recruit, groom, and sexually abuse girls.

2. **The Trump administration ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, TX.** In a statement, the State Department said the order comes in response to repeated violations of American sovereignty by China, including "massive illegal spying and influence operations" throughout the U.S. The move represents a significant escalation in the Trump administration's ongoing political and economic battle with China. Aside from the embassy in Beijing, the U.S. has five consulates in mainland China — in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Wuhan, and Shenyang. A spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on the U.S. to reverse the decision immediately, "Otherwise China will certainly make legitimate and necessary reactions."

3. **Customs and Border Protection confirmed that it deployed officers from three paramilitary units to Portland, OR** as part of a federal crackdown on protests against racism and police brutality. A CPB spokesperson said in an email that they have "agents and officers from our special operations groups deployed" to the area, but did not give any details about how many agents were deployed. Several videos posted online show officers in camouflage uniforms with no clear identification badges using force and unmarked vehicles to transport arrested protesters, which civil-rights advocates have said violate protesters’ right to free speech under the First Amendment.
