1. **U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson is scheduled to sentence Roger Stone today in Washington.** Stone was found guilty on all counts and convicted in 2018 of lying to Congress and threatening a witness. Stone's attorneys are still challenging his conviction on claims of juror misconduct, and Judge Jackson is still separately considering the request.

2. **Trump tweeted a clip from Tucker Carlson's show that suggests Trump could be considering a pardon for Stone.** "President Trump could end this travesty in an instant with a pardon," Carlson posits, "and there are indications tonight that he will do that." Trump recently pardoned or commuted the sentences of 11 high-profile criminals, including disgraced politician Rod R. Blagojevich, convicted junk bond king Michael Milken, and former New York police commissioner Bernard Kerik.

* **Trump is assembling a team of advisers to help manage the clemency process as he considers more pardons.** The White House is moving to take more direct control over pardons and commutations by limiting the DOJ's role in the clemency process. Meanwhile, Trump is said to be weighing a flurry of additional pardon announcements.

1. **Trump named longtime loyalist Richard Grenell as acting director of national intelligence.** Grenell is the ambassador to Germany and has barely any experience when it comes to intelligence or running a large bureaucracy, but he is now in charge of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies. Grenell has a history of ideological advocacy, even in his position as a diplomat. Grenell will remain ambassador to Germany while he serves as acting DNI.
