1. **Chinese intelligence operatives pushed fake text messages and Facebook posts in March claiming the Trump administration was planning to lock down the entire country in order to prevent looting and rioting related to the coronavirus, U.S. officials say.** One of the messages warned that the Trump administration planned to announce the lockdown "as soon as they have troops in place to help prevent looters and rioters." The fake messages cited a Department of Homeland Security source who said he "got the call last night" and was told to "pack and be prepared for the call today with his dispatch orders." The messages became so widespread in mid-March that the White House National Security Council had to make an announcement to clarify that they were "FAKE." The exact origin of the messages is unclear, but six U.S. officials said American intelligence agencies have assessed that Chinese operatives helped push the messages and texts across the country.

2. **Two people in California who died in mid-February had COVID-19, indicating that the coronavirus may have reached the U.S. and become fatal weeks earlier than previously thought**. Until now, the earliest known fatalities from the virus were believed to have occurred on Feb. 26 in a Suburb of Seattle, WA. But tissue samples taken from two people who died on Feb. 6 and Feb. 17 in Santa Clara County, CA recently tested positive for COVID-19, pushing back the earliest deaths publicly attributed to the virus by weeks. It's still unclear how those two people contracted the virus, but local public health officials say the cases are believed to be community transmissions.

3. **Trump threatened via Twitter to "shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats" that "harass" U.S. Navy ships at sea**. The threat comes days after the Pentagon claimed 11 Iranian ships took "dangerous and provocative" actions near U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships while they were conducting training operations in international waters in the Persian Gulf. The Iranian ships reportedly came within 10 yards of the bow of a U.S. Coast Guard ship.
