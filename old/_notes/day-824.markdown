1. **The White House instructed a former official in charge of the security clearance process to refuse to comply with a subpoena from the House of Representatives.** Democrats subpoenaed Carl Kline for an interview, but Trump's deputy counsel argued in a letter that the subpoena "unconstitutionally encroaches on fundamental executive branch interests." Kline's attorney said Kline, who now works for the Department of Defense, is being forced to choose between "two masters from two equal branches of government," and that Kline intends to "follow the instructions of the one that employs him." Kline worked for two years as Trump's personnel security director, during which time at least 25 people received security clearances despite serious concerns raised during the vetting process. House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings says Kline will be held in contempt if he doesn't comply with the subpoena.

2. **Oil prices jumped to a six-month high after the White House decided not to renew waivers that allow countries to buy Iranian oil** despite U.S. sanctions against the country. China, India, Turkey, and other countries who import Iranian oil will now face sanctions if they continue to purchase oil from Iran, OPEC's fourth-largest producer, after the waivers are officially lifted on May 1. As a result, Iran has threatened to close the Straight of Hormuz, an important shipping lane and the only seaborne route out of the Persian Gulf.

3. **Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to name a new settlement in the Golan Heights after Trump.** Netanyahu said there was a "need to express our appreciation" to Trump for officially recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the illegally occupied territory last month.
