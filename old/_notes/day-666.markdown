2. **Prosecutors inadvertently revealed secret criminal charges filed against Wikileaks founder Julian Assange** in the U.S. by accidentally mentioning the charges in [an unrelated court filing](https://pacer-documents.s3.amazonaws.com/179/399086/18919235200.pdf). "The court filing was made in error," said a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney's office in Virginia. "That was not the intended name for this filing." The charges against Assange center around the publication of emails from Democrats during the 2016 presidential campaign.

3. **Besty DeVos has been receiving around-the-clock security from U.S. Marshals since shortly after she was confirmed.** No other cabinet member has received the armed detail, which could cost taxpayers $19.8 million through Sept. 2019. It remains unclear who specifically made the original request, but Jeff Sessions first approved the protection on Feb. 13, 2017. The security detail cost $5.3 million in fiscal year 2017 and $6.8 million for fiscal year 2018.

4. **The Pentagon failed its first-ever comprehensive audit.** The audit found U.S. Defense Department accounting discrepancies that could take years to resolve. Some 1,200 auditors examined financial accounting on a wide range of spending, including on weapons systems, military personnel, and property. "We failed the audit, but we never expected to pass it," said Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan. "It was an audit on a $2.7 trillion dollar organization, so the fact that we did the audit is substantial," he added. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pentagon-audit-idUSKCN1NK2MC))
