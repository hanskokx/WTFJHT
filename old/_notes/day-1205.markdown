1. **The U.S. unemployment rate is now at 14.7%** — the highest since the Great Depression. The U.S. lost a total of 20.5 million jobs in April. The "real" unemployment rate, which includes the underemployed and those who aren't currently looking for jobs, jumped to 22.8%. In total, the U.S. has lost roughly 21.4 million jobs since the spread of COVID-19.

2. **Senate Republicans have started preparing for a swift confirmation process if a vacancy on the Supreme Court opens up before the November election.** Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's recent hospitalization has raised the prospect of another possible vacancy for Trump to fill. GOP senators say they plan to act quickly if an opening presents itself, despite denying Obama the same opportunity at the end of his second term. If there's a vacancy, "we're going to fill it," said Sen. John Barrasso. "If you thought the Kavanaugh hearing was contentious this would probably be that on steroids," said Sen. John Cornyn. "Nevertheless," he added, "if the president makes a nomination then it’s our responsibility to take it up." Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, meanwhile, said in 2016 that during an election year voters should be the ones decide which president should choose the next Supreme Court justice. But McConnell has repeatedly said he plans to fill any vacancy that opens up under Trump. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/08/republicans-ready-supreme-court-vacancy-243574))

3. **White House staff will now be tested for the coronavirus on a daily basis after Trump's personal valet tested positive.** "In addition to social distancing, daily temperature checks and symptom histories, hand sanitizer, and regular deep cleaning of all work spaces," the deputy White House press secretary said in a statement, "every staff member in close proximity to the president and vice president is being tested daily for Covid-19 as well as any guests."
