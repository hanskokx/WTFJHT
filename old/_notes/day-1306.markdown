1. **Seven states are preparing to sue the Trump administration to prevent operational changes and funding lapses that could affect voting in the 2020 presidential election.** Attorneys general in Virginia, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Washington, and North Carolina are in discussions about how best to approach the suit. New York is reportedly also considering action. The states are expected to announce the lawsuit early this week. Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said the cohort is working "to determine what Trump and \[US Postmaster General Louis\] DeJoy are doing, whether they have already violated or are likely to violate any laws, and what tools we have at our disposal to put a stop to President Trump's ongoing attack on our Postal Service and our democracy."

2. **House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she would call the House back from summer recess this week for a vote on legislation that would block changes at the Postal Service that could disenfranchise voters who use mail-in ballots.** The House was not scheduled to return until Sept. 14, but is now expected to consider a Postal Service bill as early as Saturday. The Postal Service is expected to receive as many as 80 million mail-in ballots cast by Americans who are worried about voting in person because of the coronavirus. Pelosi said she called on the House to return to session this week because "Lives, livelihoods and the life of our American democracy are under threat from the president."

3. **Trump suggested that the FDA should approve another unproven experimental coronavirus treatment.** Trump said an extract from the oleander plant should be marketed as a dietary supplement or approved as a drug to cure COVID-19, despite lack of proof that it works. The experimental botanical extract, oleandrin, was promoted to Trump during an Oval Office meeting in July. It has been embraced by HUD Secretary Ben Carson and MyPillow.com CEO Mike Lindell â€” a prominent Trump donor who recently took a financial stake in the company that develops the extract. Carson has enthusiastically promoted oleandrin to Trump administration officials and to the president himself. There is no public data or peer-reviewed research showing oleandrin has ever been tested in animals or humans for its efficacy against COVID-19.

4. **Trump told his aides that he'd like to schedule another meeting with Vladimir Putin before the November election.** Administration officials are considering a possible meeting next month in New York. People familiar with the discussions said the goal of the meeting would be to announce progress towards a new nuclear arms control agreement between the U.S. and Russia. Trump sees a summit as an opportunity to be presidential and demonstrate he's able to negotiate agreements. Trump and his team also plan to have him hold more meetings with world leaders in the weeks leading up to the election.
