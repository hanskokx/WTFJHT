**The Supreme Court announced that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has died of metastatic pancreatic cancer**, setting up a fight over filling a Supreme Court seat with less than 50 days until the election. ‚ÄúOur nation has lost a jurist of historic stature,‚Äù Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement. ‚ÄúToday we mourn, but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her ‚Äî a tireless and resolute champion of justice.‚Äù 

Ginsburg was appointed in 1993 by Clinton and was only the second woman to serve on the Supreme Court. Ginsburg had overcome four bouts with pancreatic, lung, and colon cancer since 1999. Following a recurrence in July, Ginsburg vowed to stay on the court "as long as I can do the job full steam." 

The vacancy, however, gives Trump the opportunity to name her successor, and Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans have promised to try to fill the vacancy. In 2016, Senate Republicans refused to consider Judge Merrick Garland, saying that holding hearings in the last year of a president‚Äôs term would deprive voters of a chance to weigh in on what kind of justice they wanted. 

Early voting, meanwhile, has [already](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/09/18/us/trump-vs-biden#voters-in-virginia-minnesota-south-dakota-and-wyoming-have-started-casting-ballots) [begun](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/517063-early-voting-begins-in-minnesota-other-states-ahead-of-november-election) in [Virginia](https://wtop.com/local-politics-elections-news/2020/09/1st-day-of-early-voting-in-virginia-draws-massive-crowds/), Wyoming, South Dakota, and Minnesota. 

According to a former Trump White House official, McConnell, who has called the obstruction of Garland "the most important decision I‚Äôve made in my political career," [told donors  earlier this year](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/20/how-mitch-mcconnell-became-trumps-enabler-in-chief) "that when R.B.G. meets her reward, even if it‚Äôs October, we‚Äôre getting our judge.

"Fair is fair," Murkowski said. 

Meanwhile in Minnesota, Trump ‚Äì [apparently unaware](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/us/politics/joe-biden-trump-minnesota.html) of Ginsburg‚Äôs death ‚Äì [launched](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/09/18/us/trump-vs-biden?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage#in-minnesota-trump-launches-into-sexist-attacks-unaware-of-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburgs-death) into a series of sexist attacks on Hillary Clinton and stoked fears of Islamic terrorism that would occur if Biden were elected.

Ginsburg, who once called then-presidential candidate Trump a "faker" and more recently described this period of American history as ‚Äúan aberration,‚Äù dictated the following statement days before her death: "My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed."

* **üìå [Day 1330](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/09/10/day-1330/): Trump unveiled a revised list of 20 potential Supreme Court justices that includes Sens. Tom Cotton and Ted Cruz.** Trump's top aides and advisors have encouraged him for months to release an updated list of justices ahead of Election Day as a way to remind his base what's at stake on November 3. Cotton said he was "honored" to be selected for the list and that he believes "the Supreme Court could use some more justices who understand the difference between applying the law and making the law." Cruz said in a statement that he is "grateful for the president‚Äôs confidence in me and for his leadership in nominating principled constitutionalists to the federal bench." The list's release was originally slated to take place prior to the Republican National Convention.

* **What Ruth Bader Ginsburg‚Äôs Death Means for America**. "But her passing less than two months before the presidential election also tosses one more lit match into the tinderbox of national politics in 2020: It will surely inflame a deeply polarized country already riven by a deadly pandemic, a steep economic downturn, and civil unrest in its major cities."
