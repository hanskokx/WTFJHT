1. **Attorneys for the ACLU told a federal judge that the Trump administration has taken nearly a thousand migrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border since the judge ordered the government to cease family separations** more than a year ago. One man lost his daughter because a Border Patrol agent claimed he had failed to change the girl's diaper. Another had his child taken from him because he had a property damage conviction with alleged damage worth just $5. Another man who has a speech impediment had his 4-year-old son taken from him because he couldn't clearly answer Border Patrol agents' questions. Of the tens of thousands of children who have been taken into custody at the border, 911 were separated since the June 2018 court order to end family separations.

2. **The Department of Justice is investigating whether former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke used personal email accounts for official government business**. The investigation is part of a larger probe into the former Republican congressman from Montana, according to a letter released by House Democrats. The letter is the first public confirmation of a criminal investigation into Zinke, who has been criticized for mixing his personal, political, and official business while in Trump's cabinet. The Interior Department's acting inspector general told lawmakers that the email investigation has been combined with an ongoing probe that the IG is conducting with the DOJ, which includes Zinke's role in a land deal with the chairman of Halliburton and the Interior Department's obstruction of a tribal casino project in Connecticut following extensive lobbying by a rival casino company.

3. **Trump sent the U.S. special presidential envoy for hostage affairs to Sweden to oversee the court proceedings and show support for rapper A$AP Rocky**. The Harlem rapper's real name in Rakim Mayers, and he is accused of beating a 19-year-old man in Stockholm on June 30. Mayers pleaded not guilty to the assault charges and claims that he acted in self-defense. Trump sent special envoy Robert O'Brien to Stockholm to monitor court proceedings, a move that drew criticism from observers. It's unclear why Oâ€™Brien, whose job is to advise the government on hostage issues, was selected for the trip. The former U.S. ambassador to the Organisation for Security & Cooperation in Europe called the move a "shameful abuse of a serious office."

4. **A former congressional staffer who worked to discredit the Mueller investigation has been promoted on the National Security Council staff**.

Now, Patel has been promoted to a leadership position focused on counterterrorism at the NSC's Directorate of International Organizations and Alliances.
