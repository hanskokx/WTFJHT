1. **FBI Director Christopher Wray told the Senate that the White House limited the re-opened investigation into the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh.** Wray said the inquiry was "very specific in scopeâ€”limited in scope," but insisted that the process was "consistent with the standard process for such investigations going back a long ways." He declined to answer any specifics about what the White House would or would not allow the FBI to examine. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/10/kavanaugh-fbi-probe-limit-888667))

2. **U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts referred the allegations of judicial misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh to outside judges for investigation.** More than a dozen misconduct complaints were forwarded to Roberts after they were deemed substantive enough to require outside investigation by the D.C.

3. **Trump recently spoke with Jeff Sessions' own chief of staff about replacing him as attorney general.** It is not clear whether Trump wanted Matthew G. Whitaker to take over on an interim basis or to be nominated in a more permanent capacity, nor did Trump make his intentions clear or definitive.

4. **Melania Trump believes she is "the most bullied person in the world."** She said it is harder to govern when "you always need to watch your back."
