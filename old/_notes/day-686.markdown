1. **Jeff Sessions says he doesn't miss being a senator and he doesn't plan to run again anytime soon.** "I've been clearing my brain," Sessions said during an interview. "Iâ€™ll go to Alabama, do some things and then that will clarify things a little more before I worry about making a statement."

2. **Pat Cipollone will start as the new White House counsel on Monday after a nearly two-month delay since his appointment.** Trump appointed Cipollone in October as Don McGahn's replacement after McGahn stepped down on Oct. 17. Cipollone will start his new job just as House Democrats are preparing to assume their new committee chairmanship roles in January.

3. **Democrats plan to send Mueller the transcripts of testimony by some of Trump's closest associates when they take back the House next month.** Democrats want Mueller to review the transcripts for evidence and possible falsehoods. The list of testimony transcripts includes Jared Kushner, Trump Jr., Roger Stone, Corey Lewandowski, Hope Hicks, and others.

4. **Sen. Jeff Flake's decision to block Trump's judicial nominees until a bill to protect the Mueller investigation is significantly disrupting the Senate Judiciary Committee's attempts to fill the lower courts with Trump's picks.** Without Flake's support, the nominees are unlikely to secure the favorable votes necessary to advance their nominations out of committee and they'll have to be renominated next year. "We can have the markup, I will just vote no," Flake said. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/05/politics/senate-judiciary-committee-jeff-flake/index.html))
