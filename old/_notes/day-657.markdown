1. **Democrats took back control of the House of Representatives for the first time in eight years, while Republicans managed to hold on to their majority in the Senate.** Republican governors were elected in Ohio and Florida, while Democrats beat Gov. Scott Walker in Wisconsin and Gov. Schuette in Michigan. Democrats won big in the suburbs, which are typically Republican strongholds. High-profile progressive candidates in Georgia, Florida, and Texas were defeated by Republican candidates.

2. **More than 100 women were elected to federal office, including the first Native American and first Muslim women elected to Congress.** Maine and South Dakota also elected their first female governors.
