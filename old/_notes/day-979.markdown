2. **The Senate voted by unanimous consent to approve a resolution calling for the release of the whistleblower complaint**.

Trump also told Pelosi that he wasn't responsible for the whistleblower complaint being withheld from Congress.

4. **Details from a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy are not likely to be verbatim or come from a recording of the call**. Instead, the "transcript" will likely be cobbled together from written notes taken by U.S. officials who listened in on the call. Rather than record the call, standard practice for calls between a president and a foreign leader is to have at least two or more note-takers from the National Security Council on the call, usually CIA officers.
