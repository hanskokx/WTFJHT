1. **Trump's name was invoked in direct connection with 17 cases of criminal violent acts, threats of violence, or allegations of assault.** Nearly all of the cases – 16 out of 17 – include court documents and direct evidence of someone echoing presidential rhetoric, not protesting it. The suspects and perpetrators in the 17 cases are mostly white men, while the victims represent a variety of minority groups, including African-Americans, Latinos, Muslims, and gay men.

2. **Voting machine errors are already cropping up for a number of early voting ballots in Georgia and Texas.** The errors in Texas appear so far to be working to the advantage of Ted Cruz over his Democratic challenger, Beto O'Rourke, while those in Georgia appear to favor Republican Brian Kemp. Civil rights groups and voters in both states have already filed complaints alleging that the voting machines deleted their votes for Democratic candidates or switched them to Republicans. Experts have blamed the errors on outdated software and old machines. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/05/voting-machine-errors-texas-georgia-2018-elections-midterms-959980))

3. **NBC aired the racist anti-immigration political ad approved by Trump that CNN previously refused to air because it was deemed too racist.** NBC ran a shorter version of the ad, which did not include the false claim that Democrats let a cop killer back into the country after he was deported and "let him stay." But the ad still drew a connection between immigrants and crime, a common Trump media tactic. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/us/politics/nbc-caravan-advertisement.html))

4. **Trump: Climate change "goes this way" but "will it go back like this, I mean will it change back? Probably."** Trump made the comments after being presented with the evidence for man-made climate change during an interview. He also said he believes human activity contributes to climate change: "Well, I think we’ve contributed, we certainly contribute, I mean, there’s certain pollutants that go up and there’s certain things that happen."
