1. **Germany rejected Trump's suggestion that Russia should be allowed to re-join the G7 meeting of the world's leading economies.** Germany's foreign secretary said there was no prospect of re-admitting Russia until it had resolved the situation in eastern Ukraine and Crimea. In June, Trump said it was "common sense" for Russian President Vladimir Putin to be invited back into the G7. Russia used to be a member of the group, then called the G8, until it invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and backed a rebellion in eastern Ukraine.

2. **One of the first large studies of the safety and effectiveness of a coronavirus vaccine began in the U.S. this morning.** The double-blind study is a Phase 3 clinical trial and will enroll 30,000 healthy people at 89 sites around the country. Half of the patients will receive two shots of the vaccine, spaced 28 days apart, and the other half will receive two shots of a saltwater placebo. The main goal of the trial is to determine whether the vaccine can prevent people from contracting COVID-19. It will also try to find out if the vaccine can prevent severe COVID-19 cases and death, as well as whether it can prevent infection entirely, and if just one shot can prevent the illness. The company that makes the vaccine says it would be able to deliver about 500 million doses per year, and possibly up to a billion doses per year, starting in 2021. Moderna also said it does not plan to sell the vaccine at cost, but will sell it for profit instead. Moderna has received at least $955 million in federal funding to develop a vaccine.

3. **Melania Trump will announce a plan to renovate the White House Rose Garden.** The plan includes electrical upgrades for television appearances and a new walkway and new flowers and shrubs. Melania calls the renovation an "act of expressing hope and optimism for the future," and said that during difficult times, "the White House and the Rose Garden have always stood as a symbol of our strength, resilience and continuity." Her husband, however, has repeatedly used the Rose Garden to break norms on how presidents use the space and it has become his preferred venue for announcing executive actions, boasting about the economy, and extending political battles. The renovations will be supported by the National Park Service and funded by private donations.

4. **Trump said he will no longer be able to throw out the ceremonial first pitch for the New York Yankees on Aug. 15 because of his "strong focus" on the coronavirus.** Trump has never thrown out a first pitch while in office, but said he "will make it later in the season!" The decision by the Yankees to invite Trump to throw out the opening pitch drew criticism from some NY elected officials, including NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio and Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr., who contrasted the franchise's rhetorical support for racial justice and equality with Trump's record on race relations.
