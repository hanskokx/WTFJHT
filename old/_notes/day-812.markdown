1. **Lawyers for an attorney who worked for the Obama and Clinton administrations say he expects to be indicted on charges related to his work with Ukraine as part of an investigation initiated by Mueller's office.** If indicted, Gregory B. Craig would be the first Democrat to be charged in a case tied to the special counsel's Russia investigation. Craig would also be the first person to be charged after Mueller finished his investigation. The case against Craig is related to the Foreign Agents Registration Act, the same act under which Paul Manafort pleaded guilty to acting as an unregistered foreign agent. Craig's attorneys, however, do not expect him to be charged with violating the act. They expect him to be charged with making false statements to Justice Department officials.

2. **Trump's older sister has retired as a federal appeals judge amid an investigation into whether she violated judicial conduct rules by participating in fraudulent tax schemes with her siblings.** Complaints against Judge Maryanne Trump Barry were filed last October after a New York Times investigation found that she benefited financially from most of the tax schemes and was simultaneously in a position to influence actions taken by her family. Barry hasn't heard a case in more than two years, but she was still listed as an inactive senior judge, just short of full retirement. Barry filed her retirements papers just ten days after a federal court released a letter on Feb. 1 stating that the complaints against her were "receiving the full attention" of a judicial complaint council. Now that's she's retired, the investigation has been rendered moot, since retired judges are not subject to the rules of judicial conduct.

3. **British authorities arrested Julian Assange inside the Ecuadoran embassy in London in response to a U.S. extradition request related to a single charge of conspiracy to disclose classified information that could be used to injure the United States.** A U.S. federal court unsealed an indictment against Assange, who has been staying at the embassy for the last seven years under asylum protections from the Ecuadoran government. Ecuador rescinded his asylum protection, and British authorities says Assange is now expected to "appear in custody at Westminster Magistratesâ€™ Court as soon as possible."
