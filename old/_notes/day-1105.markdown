1. **Members of Trump's legal defense team have made thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to GOP senators overseeing the impeachment trial**. Ken Starr and Robert Ray gave thousands to Mitch McConnell last year before joining Trump's team, months before McConnell announced that he would be working in "total coordination with the White House counsel's office and the people who are representing the president in the well of the Senate" during the impeachment trial. Star gave $2,800 to McConnell in July 2019 and Ray gave the maximum $5,600 to McConnell in September 2019.

2. **A total of 50 U.S. service members have now been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury as a result of the Iranian missile strikes earlier this month on Iraqi bases hosting U.S. troops**. Last week, the Pentagon listed 34 service members who had been diagnosed with TBI, including concussions. Of the 50 current patients, 31 received treatment in Iraq and have returned to active duty.

3. **Trump will sign a new North American trade agreement during a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House today**. The signing of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will include lawmakers from around the country, as well as workers, farmers, CEOs, and officials from Mexico and Canada â€” but not the key Democrats who worked on the agreement for months. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal and other Democrats who negotiated to expand the labor, environmental and enforcement provisions in the agreement were not invited to the ceremony. The USMCA must still be ratified by Canada before it can take effect. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-usmca-idUSKBN1ZS0I5))

4. **House Republican leaders are experiencing a fundraising crisis and are worried it could affect their ability to regain a majority in the 2020 election**. "They are kicking our ass," said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy at a private GOP meeting on Tuesday. The DCCC out-raised the NRCC by $40 million in 2019, and individual Democratic candidates are continuing to out-raise their Republican opponents. Democrats currently hold a 35-seat majority in the House, with five vacancies. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/28/house-gop-fundraising-2020-107572))
