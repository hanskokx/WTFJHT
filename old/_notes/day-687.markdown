1. **White House chief of staff John Kelly is expected to resign his post in the coming days.** Kelly and Trump have reportedly reached an impasse in their relationship and neither sees the situation as tenable. The two have also stopped speaking entirely in recent days. Trump has been actively discussing possible replacements, but nothing has been finalized for now.

2. **Trump attacked the Mueller investigation again in an error-laden tweetstorm this morning**, during which he painted Mueller as biased and full of conflicts of interest. The Twitter tirade which, as usual, included no supporting evidence to back up Trump's attacks, comes just as Mueller's team is expected to release new sentencing memos today that could shed new light on the Russia probe. One of the memos will detail Michael Cohen's cooperation, while another will spell out the "crimes and lies" that led Mueller to cancel Paul Manafort's cooperation agreement.

3. **The Trump campaign and the NRA used the same consultants to launch similar TV ads campaigns at the height of the 2016 election, which could be a violation of federal campaign laws.** The ads were purchased through a firm called American Media & Advocacy Group and were aimed at the exact same demographic groups as the NRA's ad spots. They also often ran during the same shows and carried strikingly similar messages. AMAG and the other firms involved are so intertwined that the ad buys for the Trump campaign and the NRA were authorized by the same person: Jon Ferrell.

4. **The Trump 2020 campaign has decided on a campaign structure that includes three offices split between New York and DC.** The main headquarters of the campaign will once again be located in Trump Tower, but this time they will have satellite offices at the RNC building on Capitol Hill and in nearby Rosslyn, VA.

5. **CNN's New York offices have been given the all-clear after someone called in a bomb threat last night.** "The NYPD has now given us the all clear, and employees have been permitted to return to the building," said CEO Jeff Zucker. "The building is secure and safe for everyone to return in the morning." The NYPD said the threat was not substantiated.
