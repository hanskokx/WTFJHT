1. **The CDC is considering revising federal coronavirus guidelines to encourage people to wear masks or cover their faces as they go about their lives â€” even if they aren't exhibiting any symptoms.** Currently, the government does not recommend it. The recommendations currently under consideration would make it clear that the public should not use medical masks like the N95 masks that are in short supply, but instead use do-it-yourself cloth coverings to help contain the spread of the virus.

2. **A federal judge called on ICE to release migrants held in family detention centers to reduce the risk of coronavirus outbreaks in confinement and in the surrounding communities.** Judge James Boasberg of Washington did not order the release of the roughly 1,350 migrants at three detention centers in Pennsylvania and Texas, but he did order ICE officials to provide a report on their efforts to release them by next week. "Circumstances are changing rapidly," the judge said, "and if there are cases in these centers or there are other problems that are not compliant, I will revisit."

3. **A health-insurance company with close ties to Jared Kushner built the coronavirus information website for the Trump administration.** Trump initially claimed that Google was helping to build the site, which turned out not to be true. Instead, a team of engineers and executives at Oscar Health spent five days building it at the request of the Trump administration. Shortly thereafter, the website was suddenly and mysteriously nixed. The full extent of Oscar Health's work on the project has not been previously reported. Kushner's younger brother Joshua is a co-founder and major investor in Oscar Health, and Jared Kushner partially owned or controlled the company before he joined the Trump administration.

4. **A recent analysis from economists at the Federal Reserve in St. Louis projects that the number of unemployed Americans could reach as high as 47 million people, or 32.1%, as a result of the coronavirus.** St. Louis Fed economist Miguel Faria-e-Castro wrote in a research paper last week that this is "a rather unique shock that is unlike any other experienced by the U.S. economy in the last 100 years." The latest estimates do not account for workers who drop out of the labor force and bring down the unemployment rate, nor do they include estimates of the impacts from the recently passed government stimulus package, which extends unemployment benefits and subsidizes companies that don't cut their staff.

5. **Rep. Mark Meadows officially resigned from Congress on Monday to go serve as Trump's newest chief of staff.** Meadows was tapped for the position on March 6 after announcing in December that he would not seek reelection in North Carolina in 2020. Meadows' resignation was effective at 5 p.m. ET on Monday and he is scheduled to begin his new position starting today. Meadows will be Trump's fourth chief of staff, succeeding acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, as well as Reince Priebus and John Kelly.
