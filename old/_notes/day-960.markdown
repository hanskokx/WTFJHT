1. **The U.S. added just 130,000 in August, signaling a slowdown in the pace of job growth**. That number would have been even lower without the temporary hiring of 25,000 government workers for the 2020 Census. Excluding all government hiring, private businesses only added 96,000 jobs, the fewest since May. Manufacturers added just 3,000 jobs last month. The unemployment rate remained at 3.7%.

2. **Congressional investigators identified possible failures in Deutsche Bank AG's money laundering controls in its dealings with Russian oligarchs**. Investigators discovered the potential failures after going through a series of transaction records, emails, and other documents turned over to Congress by the bank. The inquiry found instances where bank staff flagged concerns about new Russian clients and transactions but were ignored by managers. Congress is also looking into whether the bank allowed entities to funnel illegal funds into the United States as a correspondent bank by processing transactions for others.

3. **Four states are planning to cancel their Republican presidential primaries and caucuses**. Republican parties in South Carolina, Nevada, Arizona, and Kansas are expected to complete the cancellation of their primaries at meetings this weekend. The parties of incumbent presidents seeking reelection often cancel their primaries to save party money at the state level, but Trump's challengers say the moves are undemocratic and represent the latest illustration of Trumpâ€™s takeover of the entire Republican Party apparatus.

4. **Trump called a Fox News correspondent to the Oval Office to insist that he wasn't wrong when he claimed Hurricane Dorian could have hit Alabama**. "He stressed to me that forecasts for Dorian last week had Alabama in the warning cone," said Fox News senior White House correspondent John Roberts. "He insisted that it is unfair to say Alabama was never threatened by the storm." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/05/politics/donald-trump-alabama-fox-news-white-house/index.html))

5. **A White House official said Trump was the one who drew on a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration map with a sharpie** to make it look like Dorian was poised to strike Alabama. "No one else writes like that on a map with a black Sharpie," said the official.
