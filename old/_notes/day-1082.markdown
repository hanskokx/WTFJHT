1. **Dozens of Iranians and Iranian-Americans were stopped and held for additional questioning at the U.S.-Canadian border as tensions increased between the U.S. and Iran**. Some of the more than 60 travelers were held for up to 10 hours and asked about their political views and allegiances before they were released, while others were denied entry into the United States. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection denied the claims that travelers were stopped or referred to "secondary screening" because of their country of origin.

2. **Sen. Lindsey Graham suggested that Republicans should try to change the Senate rules regarding impeachment so they can hold a Senate trial within days if Nancy Pelosi refuses to submit the articles of impeachment against Trump**. Mitch McConnell gave a speech on the Senate floor on Friday arguing that "we can’t hold a trial without the articles; the Senate’s own rules don’t provide for that." But Graham said he would work with McConnell on a unilateral Republican move that would allow the Senate to proceed without the articles, which charge Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. A 51-vote majority is required to change the rules for the impeachment trial.
