Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai'i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, and Virginia also joined the lawsuit. Several nonprofit organizations have also announced plans to sue.

2. **Roger Stone posted an Instagram photo of the federal judge presiding over his case with crosshairs near her head just days after the judge imposed a gag order on him.** The photo of Judge Amy Berman Jackson was posted alongside a caption that referred to her as "an Obama appointed judge who dismissed the Benghazi charges against Hillary Clinton and incarcerated Paul Manafort prior to his conviction for any crime." The post also mentioned the "Deep State" and featured a plea to help Stone "fight for my life" by donating to his legal defense fund. Stone later deleted the post and issued an apology.

3. **Rod Rosenstein will resign as deputy AG and leave the Justice Department in March.** Incoming AG William Barr is expected to name Rosenstein's successor as early as this week. Justice Department officials say Rosenstein's departure has nothing to do with Andrew McCabe's recent interview on 60 Minutes, during which he mentioned conversations he had with Rosenstein about the 25th Amendment. Rosenstein has reportedly always seen his post as a two-year gig. It is unclear what this means for Mueller's investigation, but it will likely be handed off to Barr.
