1. **Trump suggested that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff could face "arrest for treason"** over his recent statement about Trump’s call with the Ukrainian president.

2. **The attorney for the intelligence whistleblower who filed the complaint says Trump is making his client fear for his personal safety as a result of Trump's remarks**. Andrew P. Bakaj pointed to Trump's call last week for "the person who gave the whistleblower the information" to be publicly identified. In a letter to acting DNI Maguire, Bakaj said Trump's remarks "have heightened our concerns that our client's identity will be disclosed publicly and that, as a result, our client will be put in harm's way."

3. **Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kiev was unlikely to publish its version of a transcript from the July 25 call between Zelensky and Trump**. The White House published its summary of the call last week, but Zelensky said he felt it would be wrong to share the Ukrainian summary or transcript of the call. "There are certain nuances and things which I think it would be incorrect, even, to publish," Zelensky said. When asked whether Kiev would open an investigation into the claims against Biden and his son, Zelensky said Ukraine would not act solely at the behest of other nations. "We can’t be commanded to do anything," he said. "We are an independent country." ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower-zelenskiy-idUSKBN1WF152))
