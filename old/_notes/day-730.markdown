1/ **ðŸš¨UPDATE:** **The special counsel's office issued a rare statement disputing aspects of the BuzzFeed [report](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2019/01/18/day-729/#1-trump-personally-directed-michael) that Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress** about Trump's involvement in a real-estate deal with Russia during the 2016 campaign. A statement from Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, called the report's "description of specific statements to the Special Counsel's Office" and the "characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office" as it related to Cohen's Congressional testimony "not accurate." In response, BuzzFeed News Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith [tweeted](https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedBen/status/1086434282921287680): "We stand by our reporting and the sources who informed it, and we urge the Special Counsel to make clear what he's disputing." BuzzFeed's story cited two anonymous law-enforcement sources. According to different [anonymous people](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/2019/01/18/b9c40d34-1b85-11e9-8813-cb9dec761e73_story.html) who claim to be familiar with the matter, "Mueller's denial \[...\] aims to make clear that none of those statement in the story are accurate." And, another [anonymous person](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/us/politics/buzzfeed-cohen-russia-tower.html) claiming to be familiar with Cohen's testimony to Mueller's prosecutors said: "Cohen did not state that the president had pressured him to lie to Congress." The statement from the special counsel's office came nearly a day after the story was published.

3/ **Trump plans to make a "major announcement" about the border and the shutdown today.** Trump is expected to to propose extending protections for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients and individuals with Temporary Protected Status in exchange for $5.7 billion for border wall funding. Trump is expected to stop short of declaring a national emergency on the southern border. House Democrats, however, have said they're willing to add no more than $1.3 billion in border-related spending to a package of funding bills that would reopen most of the government. Trump is scheduled to speak at 4 p.m. ET.
