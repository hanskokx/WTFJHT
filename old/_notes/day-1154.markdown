1. **Rand Paul forced the Senate to delay a vote on a crucial coronavirus aid package.** Paul forced a vote on an amendment that would "require a social security number for purposes of the child tax credit" that's part of the larger COVID-19 response legislation. The amendment would also give Trump "the authority to transfer funds as necessary, and to terminate United States military operations and reconstruction activities in Afghanistan." The amendment is not expected to pass. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that the Senate would move at "warp speed" to pass the coronavirus legislation, but Paul's amendment delayed the final vote until at least Wednesday.

2. **Trump's federal personnel director quit her post with no notice yesterday.** Office of Personnel Management chief Dale Cabaniss resigned in frustration after just five months on the job due to ongoing tensions with the White House budget office and with John McEntee, a 29-year-old political appointee and Trump loyalist the budget office installed at OPM in the last month. Cabaniss felt she was being micromanaged and that her authority was not respected. Cabanissâ€™s deputy, Michael Rigas, will take over as acting head of the agency.

3. **Trump plans to immediately turn back all asylum seekers and other non-U.S. citizens trying to cross the southwestern border illegally in order to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.** Ports of entry will remain open to U.S. citizens, green card holders, select others with proper documentation, and commercial traffic. But under the new rule, Border Patrol will be under orders to immediately return back to Mexico anyone else who tries to cross the southern border between legal ports of entry. Asylum seekers will not be held at any American facility or given due process. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-mexican-border.html))

4. **The U.S. and Canada are expected to make a joint statement in the next 24-48 hours announcing the suspension of all non-essential travel between the two countries.** The details of the ban and the official definition of "non-essential travel" in this case have yet to be finalized, but officials said business and trade between the two countries will be allowed to continue. The restrictions would be mutual, unlike the current U.S. travel restrictions on Europe and China. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/17/politics/us-canada-suspend-travel/index.html))

5. **Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin warned Republican senators that unemployment could reach as high as 20% if they fail to act on a proposed coronavirus rescue package.** Mnuchin met with senators on Tuesday to urge them to vote for the $1 trillion aid package that would give cash to Americans within the next two weeks in order to help offset the economic damages caused by the spread of the coronavirus. An official from the Treasury Department said the 20% figure was not meant to be a forecast, but simply an illustration of what could happen if senators fail to act.
