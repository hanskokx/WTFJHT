1. **A White House Office of Management and Budget official directed the Defense Department to withhold military aid to Ukraine less than two hours after Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky**, according to newly released emails. Roughly 90 minutes after Trump's call with Zelensky, Michael Duffey told Pentagon officials that Trump was personally interested in the Ukraine aid and had ordered the hold himself. Duffey also told the Pentagon to keep information about the hold "closely held to those who need to know to execute the direction." The emails show Trump first became interested in the aid to Ukraine after seeing an article in the Washington Examiner on June 19 titled, "Pentagon to send $250M in weapons to Ukraine," and that some officials were concerned that withholding the aid could be a violation of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Democrats are citing the emails to fuel renewed calls for witnesses to testify in the Senate impeachment trial.
