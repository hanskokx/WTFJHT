1. **House Democrats released dozens of records that appear to show Ukraine's top prosecutor offering to give Giuliani's associate Lev Parnas damaging information about Joe Biden if the Trump administration recalled the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine**. The text messages and documents that Parnas gave to Congress also suggest that one of Parnas' associates had Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch under surveillance in Ukraine before she was recalled from her post. The revelations have led Democrats to renew their calls for the White House to release documents related to Trump's Ukraine pressure campaign that is has so far refused to turn over to Congress.

   **Other revelations in the newly-released Parnas documents:**

* Giuliani sent a message to Parnas saying that he had involved a person he called "no 1" — possibly referring to Trump — in a plan to remove a U.S. visa ban on a former Ukrainian prosecutor who planned to travel to the U.S. to make claims about Biden.

* Giuliani wrote a letter to Ukraine's then-president-elect Volodymyr Zelensky to request a May 14 meeting with Zelensky, citing Giuliani's "capacity as personal counsel to President Trump and with his knowledge and consent." The trip was canceled and the meeting never took place.

* Parnas appears to have been directly involved in the efforts to convince Zelensky to announce investigations into the Bidens.

2. **Security footage shows that two missiles, fired roughly 30 seconds apart, took down Ukrainian International Airlines Flight 752**. The missiles were launched from an Iranian military base approximately eight miles from where the plane was hit. Flight 752 was one of 19 planes that took off from Tehran in the hours after Iran launched missiles against military bases in Iraq that were housing U.S. troops in retaliation for the U.S. killing of Soleimani.

3. **Former national security adviser Michael Flynn moved to withdraw his two-year-old guilty plea for lying to the FBI during the Russia probe due to "bad faith" actions by the Justice Department**. Flynn asked a judge to withdraw his plea and to delay his sentencing by 30 days. Flynn's defense team cited his cooperation with the Mueller probe and said the government's "stunning and vindictive reversal of its earlier representations to this Court are incredible, vindictive, in bad faith, and breach the plea agreement."
