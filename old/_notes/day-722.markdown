1. **The U.S. military has started to pull out of Syria.** Military officials have refused to provide details about specific timetables or movements, but a military spokesperson said "the process of our deliberate withdrawal from Syria" has begun. He continued: "Out of concern for operational security, we will not discuss specific timelines, locations or troops movement." The number of troops or vehicles that have been withdrawn also remains unknown at this time.

2. **The government shutdown lurched into day 21, tying the record for the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.** The last time the government was shutdown for this long stretched from December 1995 until January 1996 due to a dispute between then-President Bill Clinton and the Republican-led Congress at the time.

3. **Trump was briefed on a proposal that would siphon a portion of the Army's $13.9 billion disaster fund in order to pay for portions of the wall along the southern border.** The money is meant to be used for projects all across the country, including to repair storm-damaged areas of Puerto Rico through 2020. The proposal could be implemented if Trump declares a national emergency, something he has threatened to do multiple times over the last week if negotiations with Democratic lawmakers break down.
