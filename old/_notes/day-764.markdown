1. **The U.S. will leave 200 troops in Syria even after the so-called pullout announced by Trump in December.** Trump has reportedly backed away from a complete U.S withdrawal from Syria, and will instead leave the "small peacekeeping force" in place for a period of time after the majority of forces have left the country. The decision to leave 200 troops in place came after Trump spoke with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who convinced Trump to "continue coordinating on the creation of a potential safe zone" in Syria.

2. **Trump is the only 2020 presidential candidate who won't promise not to knowingly use hacked materials that are published during the election cycle.** Every other 2020 candidate who has either announced or is in the exploratory phase has pledged not to knowingly use or reference stolen or hacked material that appears online on the grounds that it may have been obtained illegally.

3. **North Carolina's election boards ordered a new election for the state's 9th Congressional District after officials said corruption surrounding absentee ballots tainted the results of the 2018 midterm election.** The bipartisan board voted 5-0 to hold a new election after Republican candidate Mark Harris was confronted by days of evidence that one of his campaign's operatives orchestrated a ballot fraud scheme, leading Harris to call for a new vote. The race is the last unsettled 2018 congressional contest in the country. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-north-carolina-idUSKCN1QA1W3))
