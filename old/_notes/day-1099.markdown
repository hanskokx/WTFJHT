1. **The Trump administration will impose a new rule that strips protections for streams, wetlands, and other bodies of water**. The new rule replaces the "Waters of the United States" regulation, which was implemented under the Obama administration to protect certain wetlands and streams that run intermittently or run temporarily underground. The new rule removes federal protections from more than half the nation's wetlands, as well as hundreds of thousands of small waterways. It also allows landowners and property developers for the first time in decades to dump pollutants such as pesticides and fertilizers directly into many of those waterways â€” or to destroy or fill in wetlands for construction projects. A government advisory board of scientists, many of whom were appointed by Trump, wrote last month that the new rule "neglects established science."
