1. **The former Infowars Washington bureau chief says he expects to be charged by the special counsel within a matter of days.** Jerome Corsi says he doesn't know what they will charge him with, but the special counsel has indicated that he will be charged with something. "I think my only crime was that I support Donald Trump," Corsi added. "That's my crime, and now I'm going to go to prison for the rest of my life for cooperating with them." Corsi is one of more than a dozen people associated with Roger Stone who have been in contact with the special counsel. Corsi described his interactions with the special counsel as "an inquisition worthy of the KGB or the Gestapo. I feel like I've been through an interrogation session in North Korea in the Korean war."

4. **A federal judge has delayed certification of the Georgia election results over concerns about the state's voter registration system and the handling of provisional ballots.** The decision formally affects every state and federal election in Georgia, but it was felt most prominently in the race for governor, where Stacy Abrams remains with 21,000 votes of forcing a runoff election against Brian Kemp.

5. **Maryland will ask a federal judge for an order declaring that Rod Rosenstein is the acting attorney general instead of Trump-appointee and former chief of staff for Jeff Sessions, Matthew Whitaker.** If the judge issues the order, Whitaker will not be able to serve as acting attorney general. The Justice Department would appeal any such order immediately. Maryland is arguing that Whitaker's selection violated federal law and exceeded the appointment authority outlined in the Constitution.
