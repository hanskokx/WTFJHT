 4. **Mitch McConnell called for an investigation into the leak of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's letter to Diane Feinstein**, in which she alleged that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her while the two were in high school. McConnell said the Judiciary Committee "ought to take a look at" the initial media reports about Ford's letter. "I think it clearly was, honestly, a despicable thing to do to Dr. Ford," McConnell said. "And it kind of underscored the tactics that have been used: It started in committee and then went straight out into the public."

 5. **Dr. Ford has not been able to return to her home due to a near-constant stream of threats**, according to her attorneys. "They are not living at home," Dr. Ford's attorney said, "it’s going to be quite some time before they’re able to live at home. The threats have been unending, it’s deplorable." Another of Ford's attorneys said Ford has no regrets about coming forward because she "still believes it was the right thing to do."

 6. **North Korea agreed to allow nuclear inspectors to visit a key nuclear testing site that Kim Jong Un says he destroyed**, according to Mike Pompeo. South Korea says the United States and North Korea have agreed to hold a second summit between Trump and Kim as early as possible.

 7. **A new U.N. report on the effects of climate change predicts a strong risk of environmental crises by the year 2040.** The report describes worsening food shortages, wildfires, and a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040. The atmosphere could heat up by as much as 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, causing sea-level rise and intensifying drought and poverty.

 8. **A veteran Republican operative raised at least $100,000 in an effort to obtain Hillary Clinton's stolen emails just weeks before the 2016 election.** The extent of Peter W. Smith's efforts went far beyond what was previously reported in 2017. One email showed the anti-Clinton donations raised by Smith were sent to a Washington, D.C.-based scholarship fund for Russian students. "This $100k total with the $50k received from you," the author of the email wrote, "will allow us to fund the Washington Scholarship Fund for the Russian students for the promised $150K." Smith killed himself in May 2017 and left an apparent suicide note that read: "NO FOUL PLAY WHATSOEVER." ([Wall Street Journal](https://outline.com/7gcwAJ))

 9. **Federal officials have frozen Oleg Deripaska's U.S.-based assets, including massive mansions in Washington, D.C. and Manhattan** as part of a battle between the U.S. government and the Russian oligarch.

Despite the asset freezes, Deripaska has arranged to have the children and ex-wife of his business partner, Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, live inside his New York mansion.
