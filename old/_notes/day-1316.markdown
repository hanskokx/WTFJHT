1. **Trump claimed without evidence that problems with mail-in ballots on Election Day will come from election officials who are "going to count them wrong."** Trump said he's not worried about USPS's ability to deliver ballots, adding that "it has nothing to do with the post office," and that even if ballots were delivered a day late, "that's not the problem." He reiterated that the "only thing" he's worried about is "unsolicited ballots, where they're going to send 80 million unsolicited ballots to people that they don't even know if they're alive or if they're living there." He added that it would be "a catastrophic disaster for this country." There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the U.S., according to numerous investigations and studies, including Trump's own voter fraud investigatory committee, which disbanded without producing evidence of any systemic issues.
