1. **The Department of Housing and Urban Development was spending tens of thousands of dollars on upgrades to Ben Carson's office at the same time it was making drastic cuts to programs that help the poor, homeless, and elderly**.

3. **Mueller's investigators have been asking witnesses about Trump's business activities in Russia before he was elected** as part of the ongoing probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and Russian ties to the Trump campaign. Among the issues Mueller's team has been probing are questions about the timing of Trump's decision to run, potentially compromising information the Russians may have against Trump, and why a deal to brand a Trump Tower in Moscow never came to fruition.
