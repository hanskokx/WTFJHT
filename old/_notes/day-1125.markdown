1. **The White House memo justifying the assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani in January doesn't mention an imminent threat anywhere in the document**, despite it being the Trump administration's primary rationale for the attack. Instead, the two-page memo justifies the drone strike based on previous attacks and the need to deter Iran from carrying out attacks in the future. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot Engel said the memo "directly contradicts the president’s false assertion that he attacked Iran to prevent an imminent attack against United States personnel and embassies."

2. **The Department of Homeland Security will waive federal contracting laws to speed up construction of Trump's border wall.** DHS will waive 10 laws, including requirements regarding open competition, justifying selections, and receiving all bonding from a contractor before any work can begin. DHS says waiving the laws would speed up the construction of 177 miles of border wall at sites in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Presidents have waived contracting laws in the past, but this is the first time the waivers have applied to federal procurement rules — usually they waive requirements for environmental impact reviews.

3. **Federal prosecutors are considering additional charges against associates of Rudy Giuliani**. The new charges against Lev Parnas and at least one of his business partners involve the potential misleading of investors at a company called Fraud Guarantee. That same company paid Giuliani $500,000 just as Parnas began helping Giuliani arrange meetings in Ukraine to dig up dirt on Biden and his son. Prosecutors have said in court that new charges are likely, but they haven't indicated exactly which charges they are pursuing or when they would be filed.

4. **Former national security adviser John Bolton suggested that his forthcoming book contains revelations about Trump's misconduct that go beyond his pressure campaign in Ukraine**. Bolton said the Ukraine revelations were "like the sprinkles on the ice cream sundae in terms of what’s in the book." He also said the White House was trying to use its powers of classification to prevent the book, titled "The Room Where It Happened," from coming out. "I say things in the manuscript about what he (Trump) said to me," Bolton added. "I hope they become public someday."

5. **The judge presiding over Roger Stone's case ordered both sides to participate in a phone hearing after all four prosecutors in charge of the case resigned in protest**. Judge Amy Berman Jackson ordered the unusual conference call in the wake of Bill Barr's intervention in Stone's sentencing recommendation. It is unclear whether Judge Jackson will decide to proceed with Stone's sentencing on Thursday as scheduled, especially after Stone's attorneys filed a second motion for a new trial last week.
