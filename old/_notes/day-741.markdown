1. **Trump met Vladimir Putin for several minutes at the G20 summit in November without a U.S. translator or note-taker present.** Trump brought Melania to the meeting and Putin brought his own translator. The four sat at a table inside the Colón theatre in Buenos Aires, Argentina and were among the last to leave. Trump's aides said the meeting was one of several "informal" conversations between Trump and other world leaders during the summit. A Russian government said Trump and Putin spoke for roughly 15 minutes about various foreign policy issues, including an incident in the Azov Sea and the war in Syria.

2. **Russian officials secretly offered North Korea a nuclear power plant last fall in exchange for dismantling its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.** The offer was meant to help resolve the deadlocked negotiations over denuclearization between North Korea and the Trump administration. Russia offered to operate the plant and take care of all the nuclear waste back in Russia in order to reduce the likelihood of North Korea using it to build nuclear weapons. U.S. intelligence officials became aware of the Russian offer in late 2018, which marks a new attempt by Moscow to insert itself into the high-stakes nuclear talks and a string of other geopolitical matters across Asia and South America.

3. **The Pentagon is preparing to send "several thousand" additional troops to the southern border at the request of the Department of Homeland Security.** DHS officials asked for more troops to help put up concertina wire and conduct border surveillance operations. Acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan said the Pentagon will send "several thousand, and I’ll kind of leave it at that number," when asked how many troops will be deployed. Shanahan said the Pentagon will provide more details about the numbers when the decision has been finalized. Roughly 2,300 active-duty troops are currently deployed to the southern border, down from 5,900 in November. An additional 2,200 National Guard troops are also currently deployed to the border.

4. **Democrats and Republicans will meet on an exclusive committee for the first time today to begin negotiations over border security funding.** The committee has less than three weeks to strike a deal before parts of the government are shut down again. The group has jurisdiction over the language of a bill that would fund DHS, but some Republicans have suggested the group should expand the negotiations to include immigration policy more broadly.
