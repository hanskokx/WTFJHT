1. **Attorney General William Barr contradicted Trump's claim that the Secret Service asked him to go down to the security bunker beneath the White House last weekend for an "inspection."** Barr said the Secret Service instead recommended moving Trump to the bunker on June 1 for his own safety after "three days of extremely violent demonstrations" taking place outside the White House gates. "Things were so bad that the Secret Service recommended that the President go down to the bunker," Barr said. Melania Trump and her son, Barron, were also taken to the bunker for their protection.

2. **Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy now says he is "open" to renaming 10 military bases and facilities that are named after leaders of the Confederacy after previously rejecting the idea.** Secretary of Defense Mark Esper also supports having "a bi-partisan discussion on the topic," according to a spokesperson. McCarthy's reversal is due in part to the ongoing protests over the murder of George Floyd, which have "made us start looking more at ourselves and the things that we do and how that is communicated to the force as well as the American public," said one Army official. In February, the Army declared that it had no plans to rename its facilities, even after the Marine Corps announced that it would ban Confederate flags from its bases.

3. **14 states and Puerto Rico saw their highest-ever seven-day average of new coronavirus cases since the beginning of the pandemic.** Infections rates have slowed down in former hot spots like New York and Illinois, but other parts of the country that had previously avoided high numbers of cases — Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Kentucky, New Mexico, North Carolina, Mississippi, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Utah — have all started to see record high case numbers. The latest numbers are believed to stem from the efforts to reopen states across the country, but public health officials say the last two weeks of protests against police brutality will be another variable in how the virus spreads.

4. **69% of Americans say the murder of Floyd represents a broader problem within law enforcement, while 29% say it was an isolated incident.** 61% disapprove of the way Trump has handled the protests, while 35% say they approve.
