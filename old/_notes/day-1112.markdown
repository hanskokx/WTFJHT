1. **The Senate is scheduled for a final vote in Trump's impeachment trial today at 4 p.m. ET**. Senators will vote to either remove him from office and make Mike Pence the president or to acquit Trump and allow him to complete the remainder of his first term. There is little doubt that the Senate will vote to acquit him since none of the 53 Republicans in the Senate have said they will vote for removal, which requires a total of 67 votes.

2. **Susan Collins says she will vote to acquit Trump today on the final day of the Senate impeachment trial**. Collins said she thinks Trump learned a "pretty big lesson" from the impeachment process and that he will be "much more cautious in the future" when it comes to seeking foreign assistance. Trump, on the other hand, continues to insist that he did nothing wrong and that his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a "perfect phone call."

3. **Trump gave conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the middle of his State of the Union speech last night**. The medal represents the highest honor awarded to U.S. civilians. Instead of placing the medal around Limbaugh's neck himself, Trump had Melania do it before the speech continued. Limbaugh is a former "birther" conspiracy theorist and has been accused of making numerous racist, sexist, homophobic, and other offensive comments throughout his 31-year career in talk radio as the host of the "The Rush Limbaugh Show." Trump also used the speech to engineer a surprise homecoming for a veteran and his family and to award a scholarship to a young girl.

* **Many of Trump’s State of the Union claims don’t hold up.** Trump gets a lot of his facts wrong, willfully or not. In his third State of the Union address, he made a number of erroneous or misleading claims.

* **Trump touted the economy, his immigration policies, and foreign relations during his State of the Union address**. "Three years ago, we launched the Great American Comeback,” Trump said. “Tonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results."
