1. **A New York appellate court judge ruled that Simon & Schuster can go forward with the publication of Mary Trump's tell-all book about her uncle, Donald Trump.** The decision from Judge Alan D. Scheinkman reverses a lower court decision that temporarily halted publication of the book, "Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the Worldâ€™s Most Dangerous Man," which is scheduled for release at the end of July. In his decision, Judge Scheinkman declined to address the central claim from the Trump administration: that Mary Trump violated a 20-year-old non-disclosure agreement by writing the book. Instead, the judge ruled that Simon & Schuster was not a party to the agreement and therefore could not be bound by it.

3. **The Commerce Department is blocking the release of an investigation's findings into whether it pressured the head of the NOAA into supporting Trump's false claim in 2019 that Hurricane Dorian was going to hit Alabama**, according to the department's inspector general. Peggy E. Gustafson sent a memo to Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Ross claiming that staff in his department had "thwarted" the publication of her report. Gustafson says the department claims portions of her report contain information that cannot be made public, but refuses to indicate which sections. She says the department's refusal to allow the release of the report "appears to be directly linked to the content of our report and the findings of responsibility of the high-level individuals involved."

* **ðŸ“Œ [Day 1244](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/06/16/day-1244/): NOAAâ€™s acting administrator "engaged in the misconduct intentionally, knowingly, or in reckless disregard" for the agencyâ€™s scientific integrity policy** when he released a statement that backed Trumpâ€™s false statement about the path of Hurricane Dorian in 2019. Neil Jacobs criticized the National Weather Service forecast office in Birmingham for a tweet that contradicted Trumpâ€™s inaccurate tweet that Hurricane Dorian, which was then approaching the East Coast of the U.S., would hit Alabama "harder than anticipated." No punishments have been proposed, despite the violations.

* **ðŸ“Œ [Day 1110](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/02/03/day-1110/): Officials at NOAA were "sick" and "flabbergasted" about Trumpâ€™s inaccurate statements, altered forecast map, and tweets about Hurricane Dorian in September**, according to emails released in response to Freedom of Information Act requests. The emails also show that the No. 2 official at the agency claimed that neither he nor the acting administrator approved the unsigned statement that a NOAA spokesperson issued on Sept. 6, which criticized the Birmingham National Weather Service forecast office for a tweet that contradicted Trumpâ€™s inaccurate assertion that Alabama "will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated" from the Category 5 storm.
