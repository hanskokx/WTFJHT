1. **U.S. intelligence officials claimed that a Russian intelligence unit secretly offered the Taliban bounties for killing American and coalition forces in Afghanistan.** The same Russian unit has been linked to assassination attempts and other covert actions in Europe and has offered rewards for successful attacks in the past. The bounties were offered to Taliban-linked militants while the U.S. was in the midst of peace negotiations with the Taliban to end the more than 18-year war in Afghanistan, but the Taliban have not attacked American positions since a February ceasefire agreement. U.S. intelligence officials say the bounties are believed to have resulted in the deaths of multiple U.S. troops in the region over the last few years, though it is unclear exactly how many were targeted or killed under the program.

2. **Trump was briefed about the Russian bounties on U.S. and coalition forces in March.** U.S. intelligence officials and Special Operations forces in Afghanistan alerted their superiors about the covert Russian operation as early as January 2020 and said at least one U.S. service member was killed as a result of the bounties.

3. **Trump denied receiving an intelligence briefing on the alleged Russian bounty program**, claiming that he had "just" heard about it. He also claimed that officials didn't brief him or Pence on the intelligence at the time because "they did not find this info credible." Earlier, Trump tweeted that "nobody briefed or told me," Pence, or White House chief of staff Mark Meadows about the intelligence. He also called for the New York Times, which broke the story, to "reveal" its sourcing. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany also claimed on Saturday that Trump and other top administration officials were not "briefed on the alleged Russian bounty intelligence."

4. **Trump shared a video from a demonstration at a Florida retirement community that includes a man surrounded by Trump campaign signs yelling "white power" at a group of counter-protesters.** Trump retweeted the video and thanked the "great people of The Villages" in the video. He deleted the tweet about three hours after posting it. White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere later claimed that Trump "did not hear the one statement made on the video," adding that all Trump saw "was tremendous enthusiasm from his many supporters." The relevant clip appears within the first eight seconds and is reiterated by one of the other people in the video.
