1. **The U.S. government plans to launch a new program aimed at protecting voter registration databases and systems from ransomware attacks ahead of the 2020 presidential election**. The systems were compromised in 2016 by Russian hackers, who wanted to obtain information about voters. Intelligence officials say that in 2020, however, foreign hackers will not only target the databases but will also attempt to manipulate, disrupt, or destroy the data altogether. A senior U.S. official says the systems are classified as "high risk." ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-election-exclusive-idUSKCN1VG222))

2. **A growing number of farmers say they are losing patience with Trump's approach to his trade war with China**. "We’re not starting to do great again," said the president of the Minnesota Corn Growers Association in response to a Trump tweet. "Things are going downhill and downhill quickly." Farmers have increasingly raised concerns about depressed crop prices, falling farm income, and difficulty gaining access to credit.

4. **Trump said he refuses to jeopardize the wealth of the U.S. over climate "dreams" and "windmills."** Trump made the comments after skipping a G7 session on climate change over the weekend. "I feel that the United States has tremendous wealth," Trump told reporters. "I’m not going to lose that wealth, I’m not going to lose it on dreams, on windmills, which frankly aren’t working too well." The Trump administration has rolled back several U.S. environmental protection policies put in place by the Obama administration, including weakening the Endangered Species Act.
