1. **Trump asked U.S. intelligence agencies to find out whether China and the World Health Organization initially hid what they knew about the coronavirus pandemic as it emerged**. The White House sent a specific "tasking" to the National Security Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency seeking information about the early days of the outbreak. The CIA received similar instructions. Specifically, the agencies were asked to find out what the WHO knew about two research labs studying coronaviruses in Wuhan, China. "Understanding the origins of the virus is important to help the world respond to this pandemic but also to inform rapid-response efforts to future infectious disease outbreaks," said a White House spokesperson.

2. **Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to force slaughterhouses and meat processing plants to stay open during the pandemic**.

At least 20 meat and food processing workers have died, and 5,000 meatpacking workers have either tested positive for the virus or were forced to self-quarantine.
