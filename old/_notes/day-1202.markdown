1. **Dr. Anthony Fauci says the best scientific evidence shows the novel coronavirus wasn't made in a Chinese laboratory**, contradicting statements by Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Fauci also doesn't subscribe to the theory that someone found the virus in the wild and brought it into a lab before allowing it to escape and spread to the rest of the world. "If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats and what's out there now," Fauci says, the scientific evidence "is very, very strongly leaning toward this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated." He added: "Everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that \[this virus\] evolved in nature and then jumped species."

2. **The House Judiciary Committee wants to continue investigating Trump for potentially impeachable offenses related to Robert Mueller's investigation.** The committee is still trying to obtain grand jury secrets from the Mueller probe, but the Justice Department has blocked the disclosure of the materials because it plans to take the case all the way to the Supreme Court. In a letter to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, the House wrote that "its investigation into President Trump's misconduct is ongoing," and said the material from the grand jury will help it decide whether Trump "committed additional impeachable offenses in obstructing Special Counsel \[Robert\] Mueller's investigation and whether to recommend new articles of impeachment." The letter adds: "The current pandemic notwithstanding, the Committee's investigation is not 'dormant.'" The committee is particularly interested in the differences between what the witnesses from the Trump campaign told Mueller's investigators and what Trump said to Mueller in his written answers, as well as what convicted former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort said about Trump during his secret testimony.

3. **CNN's parent company sent a cease-and-desist letter accusing the Trump campaign of misusing the network's news coverage in a way that is "false, misleading and deceptive."** WarnerMedia claims a new campaign ad from the Trump re-election campaign titled, "American Comeback," takes a segment about the threat of the coronavirus on CNN's "The Situation Room" out of context. The letter claims the Trump campaign ad "purposely and deceptively edits the clip" to imply that Wolf Blitzer and Dr. Sanjay Gupta were praising Trump's January travel ban on China for saving millions of American lives, "when in fact Mr. Blitzer and Dr. Gupta were discussing recently implemented social distancing guidelines and stay-at-home orders issued by state and local governments." The letter "hereby demands" that the campaign stop airing the ad, which "has been distorted in such a way as to mislead the public."
