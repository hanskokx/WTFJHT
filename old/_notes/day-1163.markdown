1. **Trump: "I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators."** Trump was speaking to Sean Hannity on Fox News after NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned that his state would need up to 30,000 ventilators to adequately respond to the influx of COVID-19 cases. "You go into major hospitals sometimes, and they’ll have two ventilators," Trump continued. "And now all of a sudden they’re saying, 'Can we order 30,000 ventilators?'" Trump's comments come as some New York City hospitals have been forced to start sharing ventilators between as many as four patients at once, the first time such a practice has been offered as a longer-term strategy in the United States.

2. **The House is scheduled to debate and vote on the sweeping $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package today.** It is not clear whether the measure will be able to pass on a voice vote, according to the Majority Leader's office, because at least 216 members are required to be present in order for a voice vote to go forward. While most members are back in their home districts because of the coronavirus outbreak, several lawmakers are scrambling to get back to Capitol Hill for a roll-call vote because they believe at least one member will demand a recorded vote.

3. **Trump sent a letter to U.S. governors on Thursday notifying them that his administration will be issuing new guidelines to state and local governments** regarding decisions about "maintaining, increasing or relaxing social distancing and other mitigation measures" in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. The guidance will contain instructions for classifying certain counties as "high risk, medium risk or low risk," as well as data that will drive the "next phase" of the government's response. Trump also held a video conference with governors last night, and is scheduled to give another public briefing about the virus today at 5 p.m. ET.

4. **Trump said there's "no way" he'll cancel the Republican National Convention in August because of the coronavirus.** "Somebody was asking today, ‘Will you cancel your convention?’," Trump told Sean Hannity. "I said no way I’m going to cancel the convention. We’re going to have the convention, it's going to be incredible." The GOP convention is scheduled for Aug. 24-27, roughly two months before the November general election.
