1. **The White House went dark Sunday night as people continued to protest outside of its gates**. It is unclear why the Trump administration decided to do so, but all of the external lights at the White House were turned off.

2. **Trump took shelter inside an underground bunker for nearly an hour on Friday** as protests continued outside the White House and across Washington, D.C. Trump was abruptly taken by Secret Service agents inside the Presidential Emergency Operations Center, an underground bunker that is used to shelter presidents during threatening situations.

3. **The top lawyer for the FBI was forced to resign by the Justice Department over his role in the Michael Flynn investigation**. Dana Boente was asked to step down by senior figures at the DOJ, and two sources said the order came from "Attorney General William Barrâ€™s justice department." Boente was the one who signed off on a warrant in 2017 authorizing the FBI to conduct surveillance on Flynn. He also signed one of the reauthorizations to surveil Trump campaign associate Carter Page. Several of Trump's supporters have recently gone on Fox News and other conservative media outlets to criticize Boente's brief role in the Russia probe. Boente spent nearly 40 years at the FBI as its general counsel and a former acting attorney general.
