1. **The House threatened to subpoena the White House if it doesn't comply by Friday with requests for documents related to Trump's attempts to get Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son**. House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings notified committee members of the impending subpoena, noting that the White House has been ignoring Congress' voluntary requests for the documents. Cummings said the committee has "tried several times to obtain voluntary compliance with our requests for documents" over the last several weeks, but the White House hasn't responded.

1. **Mike Pompeo admitted that he was on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky** when Trump asked Zelensky to have Ukraine investigate Joe Biden and his son. "I was on the phone call," Pompeo said Wednesday during a news conference in Rome with Italy's foreign minister, hours before the State Department's inspector general's "urgent" private briefing he requested with senior congressional staff members about documents related to the Ukraine scandal. Pompeo's admission was the first time he confirmed that he was on the call â€” after previously evading questions about what he knew about the conversation and news reports that revealed he was on the call.

2. **Trump complained on Twitter that House Democrats are "wasting everyone's time and energy on BULLSHIT"** by investigating him as part of their impeachment inquiry. Trump also called House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff a "low life," blamed the impeachment inquiry for recent declines in the stock market, and suggested staffers were inappropriately listening in on his phone calls. The tweets come after Trump's suggestion Tuesday night that the impeachment inquiry amounted to an attempted coup.

3. **Trump has repeatedly talked about fortifying his wall along the U.S.-Mexico border with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators**, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He also wanted the wall to be electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. On another occasion, after he publicly suggested that soldiers should shoot migrants if they threw rocks, Trump backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But at a later meeting, Trump suggested that border patrol could shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. Aides had to remind him that shooting migrants in the legs was also illegal.

* **Trump issues misspelled response to report he wanted border moat with alligators and snakes.** "Now the press is trying to sell the fact that I wanted a Moot stuffed with alligators and snakes, with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top, at our Southern Border." Trump tweeted. ([The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-twitter-moat-border-moot-tweets-today-alligators-snakes-a9131876.html))
