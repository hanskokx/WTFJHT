1. **The Trump administration will propose a rule that would tighten food stamp restrictions and kick roughly 3.1 million people out of the program**, according to USDA officials. The current rule allows U.S. residents in 43 states to be automatically eligible for food stamps through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, if they receive benefits from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF program. The new rule would require people who receive TANF benefits to pass a review of their income and assets to determine whether they are eligible to receive food from SNAP. "Some states are taking advantage of loopholes that allow people to receive the SNAP benefits who would otherwise not qualify and for which they are not entitled," said USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue. SNAP currently provides free food to nearly 40 million Americans, or 12% of the U.S. population. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-foodstamps-idUSKCN1UI0AH))

2. **ICE and Customs and Border Patrol have been holding a Dallas-born U.S. citizen in custody for more than three weeks**. Francisco Erwin Galicia was detained along with his 17-year-old brother who lacks legal status and was prevented from using the phone for the three weeks he was in CBP custody. He was able to call his mother once he was transferred to ICE custody on Saturday. "I presented them with his original birth certificate and other documents and they ignored them," Galicia's attorney said. "He’s going on a full month of being wrongfully detained. He’s a U.S. citizen and he needs to be released now." ([Dallas Morning News](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/immigration/2019/07/22/dallas-born-citizen-picked-border-patrol-detained-three-weeks))

3. **Trump endorsed a bipartisan budget deal that doesn't include any of the federal spending cuts or restraints Republicans have previously demanded**. So far, Trump is on track to add another $1 trillion dollars to the national deficit this year. The new budget deal will raise spending by $320 billion beyond existing caps and allow the government to keep borrowing money in order to avert a fiscal crisis. If the spending bill is passed by Congress and signed by Trump, it would stop a potential debt default this fall and avoid automatic spending cuts next year.

4. **Trump recently met with Devin Nunes to discuss possible replacements for Director of National Intelligence Dan Coates**. Trump met with Nunes and other senior White House officials last week to discuss who could take over for Coates as the nation's top intelligence chief, signalling that Coates' tenure may be coming to an end. Coates has run the Office of Director of National Intelligence since the early days of the Trump administration, but his job security has constantly been up in the air ever since he contradicted Trump in statements he made about North Korea, Iran, and Syria.

5. **Two Louisiana police officers have been fired after one posted on Facebook that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez "needs a round ... and I don’t mean the kind she used to serve,"** referring to Ocasio-Cortez's previous job as a bartender. Daniel Rispoli was fired for making the post, and the other officer, Angelo Varisco, was fired for liking the post on Facebook. "These officers have certainly acted in a manner which was unprofessional," said Gretna Police Chief Arthur Lawson at a news conference, "alluding to a violent act be conducted against a sitting U.S. \[congresswoman\], a member of our government \[and\] we are not going to tolerate that."
