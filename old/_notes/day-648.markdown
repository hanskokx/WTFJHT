1. **A group of progressive Jewish leaders told Trump that he's not welcome in Pittsburgh until he denounces white nationalism.** The comments came in the wake of the mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh that left 11 dead and many more injured over the weekend. "Our Jewish community is not the only group you have targeted," the group wrote in a letter to Trump. "You have also deliberately undermined the safety of people of color, Muslims, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities. Yesterdayâ€™s massacre is not the first act of terror you incited against a minority group in our country."

2. **Trump's response to the shooting in Pittsburgh included a statement written by Jared and Ivanka condemning the attacks, after which Trump quickly returned to launching partisan attacks against his electoral enemies.** By the end of the weekend Trump was tweeting about the World Series and taking digital jabs at his foes. Hours after calling for national unity he ridiculed Tom Steyer, one of the targets of the recent pipe bomb attacks.

3. **Former President Jimmy Carter called on Brian Kemp to resign as Georgia's Secretary of State** in order to avoid damaging public confidence in the outcome of his contested race against Democrat Stacey Abrams. Stepping aside, Carter wrote a letter to Kemp, "would be a sign that you recognize the importance of this key democratic principle and want to ensure the confidence of our citizens in the outcome."
