1. **The U.S. Supreme Court refused to consider the Trump administration's challenge to a California sanctuary law that limits local police cooperation with federal immigration authorities.** The court declined to say why it wonâ€™t hear the issue, which is customary. The Trump administration wanted the Court to hear its appeal of lower court rulings that upheld the California law, which prohibits police and sheriff's departments from giving ICE agents advance notice when immigrants are about to be released after serving sentences for local crimes. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals previously ruled that local officials have no duty to help immigration agents enforce federal law.

2. **The Secret Service admitted that it used pepper spray to clear crowds of peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square** so Trump could have his picture taken in front of St. John's church in Washington, D.C., reversing an earlier statement that no one from the agency had used it. In a statement, the Secret Service acknowledged that it released information on June 5 stating that "no agency personnel used tear gas or capsicum spray during efforts to secure the area near Lafayette Park on Monday, June 1." Since that time, the statement continues, "the agency has learned that one agency employee used capsicum spray (i.e., pepper spray) during that effort."

3. **Trump's niece plans to publish a book in which she claims to be the primary source for [an explosive New York Times investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html) into Trump's tax fraud schemes.** Mary Trump plans to release the book, "Too Much And Never Enough," on Aug. 11. In it, she says she was the one who provided the Times with Fred Trump Sr.'s tax returns and other highly confidential family financial documentation. Mary Trump is the daughter of Trump's older brother, Fred Trump Jr., who died in 1981. The book also claims that Trump and Fred Trump Sr. contributed to Fred Trump Jr.'s death and neglected him at critical stages of his alcohol addiction.

4. **The Trump administration plans to end in late July the $600 additional weekly unemployment benefit created in response to the nationwide job losses stemming from the coronavirus pandemic.** "I mean, we're paying people not to work,It's better than their salaries would get," said National Economic Council Chairman Larry Kudlow. "That might have worked for the first couple of months. It'll end in late July." He added that the White House is instead considering a "reform measure" that would provide a smaller incentive for people to return to work, but said it won't be as substantial.

5. **Trump struggled to drink from a glass of water and walk down a short ramp during a commencement ceremony at West Point Military Academy on Sunday**. Video from the event shows Trump attempting to drink a glass of water during his speech, but having trouble lifting the glass to his mouth with just one hand, so he used his other hand to push the glass to his lips. After the speech, Trump can be seen gingerly walking down a ramp one step at a time as he left the stage. After the videos began circulating online, Trump took to Twitter to defend himself and claimed that the short and shallow ramp was "very long & steep, had no handrail and, most importantly, was very slippery." He also claimed that he "ran down to level ground" during the last ten feet of the ramp, adding, "Momentum!" There is no evidence that the ramp was slippery and there were no clouds in sight during the ceremony.
