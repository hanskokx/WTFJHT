1. **Trump praised Montana Rep. Greg Gianforte for body-slamming a reporter.** Gianforte pleaded guilty last year to misdemeanor assault charges related to the incident. "Any guy that can do a body slam â€” he's my kind of guy," Trump said to during a rally in Missoula. "He's a great guy, tough cookie." Trump's comments were met with cheers and laughter from the crowd.
