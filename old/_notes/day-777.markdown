1. **Leaked documents show the U.S. government maintains a secret database of activists, journalists, and social media influencers with ties to the 2018 migrant caravan.** In certain cases, Customs and Border Patrol officials placed alerts on their passports to flag them for screening at the border. Some of the people being tracked have a large "X" over their photo, indicating whether they have been arrested, interviewed, or had their documents revoked by officials. Some agents even created dossiers on each listed person. Two of the dossiers were labeled with the names of journalists, who were also listed as targets for secondary screenings at the border. "We are a criminal investigation agency, weâ€™re not an intelligence agency," a Homeland Security source explained. "We canâ€™t create dossiers on people and theyâ€™re creating dossiers. This is an abuse of the Border Search Authority."

* **ðŸ“Œ[Day 776](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2019/03/06/day-776/): ICE has been keeping tabs on a series of left-leaning and "anti-Trump protests" in New York City.** The agency tracked protests that promoted immigrants' rights and those that opposed Trump's deportation policies, plus one protest against the NRA and one that was organized by a sitting member of Congress.

1. **Paul Manafort will face the first of two sentencing hearings today more than a year after Mueller secured an 18-count indictment against the former lobbyist on charges related to tax and bank fraud.** Manafort will appear in court today to be sentenced for eight of those counts, and is expected to receive the harshest punishment of the half-dozen former Trump associates who have been prosecuted by the special counsel. Manafort's future is now in the hands of U.S. District Court Judge T.S. Ellis.

2. **Michael Cohen asked one of his attorneys last summer to raise the possibility of a pardon with Rudy Giuliani shortly after the FBI raided Cohen's home and offices.** Cohen asked his then-attorney Stephen Ryan to meet with Giuliani and discuss a possible pardon, even though he testified before the House Oversight Committee that he would never accept a pardon if it was offered to him. Cohen's current attorney Lanny Davis says Cohen stands by his testimony because he made the statements after he withdrew from a Joint Defense Agreement with Trump and many of Trump's advisers.

3. **Giuliani said attorneys for several people facing scrutiny from the Justice Department's investigations into the Trump campaign and administration have reached out to him about presidential pardons for their clients.** Giuliani refused to say which attorneys or which clients have contacted him about possible pardons. Giuliani claims he told them all that Trump would not consider granting pardons until long after the investigations are over. "I always gave one answer, and they always left disappointed," Mr. Giuliani said. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/us/politics/giuliani-trump-pardons.html))
