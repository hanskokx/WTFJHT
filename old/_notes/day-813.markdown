1. **White House officials tried to pressure Kirtsjen Nielsen and other DHS officials into releasing detainees onto the streets of sanctuary cities as a way of retaliating against Trump's political enemies.** The Trump administration first brought up the plan in a Nov. 16 email, asking whether members of a migrant caravan could be arrested when they reached the border and then transported "to small- and mid-sized sanctuary cities" where local officials have refused to cooperate with ICE and deportation authorities. The White House told ICE that the proposal would free up detention space in their facilities while also serving as a message to Democrats. One top official responded to the plan by pointing out that it was full of not only budgetary and liability concerns, but "there are PR risks as well."

2. **The House Oversight Committee threatened to hold a Justice Department official in contempt of Congress after the DOJ refused to comply with the committee's subpoena for testimony and documents related to the citizenship question on the 2020 Census.** Committee Chair Elijah Cummings said in a letter to AG William Barr that the committee would hold his principal deputy assistant AG, John Gore, in contempt of Congress if Barr didn't make him available to answer questions about Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross's decision to add the question to the census. Gore was slated to testify on Thursday but he did not appear. The committee voted 23-14 earlier this month to compel Gore to testify and for the Trump administration to provide additional documents pertaining to the citizenship question.

3. **Trump withdrew his nomination to the U.S. Senate for the next top U.S. diplomat for South Asia.** Trump nominated Defense Intelligence Agnecy official Roberty Williams five months ago to fill the post, which has been empty since Trump took office. The White house did not say why it decided to withdraw Williams' nomination. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-southasia-diplomat-idUSKCN1RO032))
