1. **Trump refused to condemn white supremacists during the first presidential debate**, instead blaming the violence at anti-police brutality demonstrations on "the left wing." Moderator Chris Wallace asked Trump if he was ready to condemn white supremacists and call on them to stand down, to which Trump responded, "Sure, I'm willing to, but I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing, not from the right wing." Biden then pressed Trump to "Say it. Do it. Say it," and Trump asked who exactly he should condemn. "The Proud Boys," Biden said, referring to the far-right "western chauvinist" hate group known for its anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric. But instead of condemning or calling on the group to stand down, Trump said, "Proud Boys — stand back and stand by," before pivoting back to criticizing anti-fascists and "the left." Members of the Proud Boys responded on social media by pledging allegiance to Trump and declaring that they are "standing by."

* **The first presidential debate in one sentence**: Trump bullied his way through the debate for 98 minutes[^1]; incessantly interrupted and insulted Biden nearly every time he spoke; Biden denounced Trump as a “clown” and told him to “shut up”[^2]; Trump declined to condemn white supremacists, questioned the legitimacy of the November election, and refused to say whether he would concede should he lose[^3], Trump claimed that he’s unfamiliar with the Proud Boys[^4]; and Biden called Trump “a racist” and “the worst president America has ever had”[^5].

2. **World stock markets and U.S. futures were mostly down in the wake of the first debate.** Shares fell in Paris, Frankfurt and Tokyo, while upbeat manufacturing data lifted shares in Hong Kong and Shanghai. U.S. futures dropped, with the contract for the S&P 500 down 0.7% and that for the Dow industrials falling 0.6%. The debate's likely impact on markets was unclear.

3. **The House adopted a resolution reaffirming lawmakers' support for a peaceful transfer of power in the event that Trump loses the election.** The measure passed with a 397-5 vote, with all five votes against coming from Republicans Matt Gaetz, Louie Gohmert, Clay Higgins, Steve King, and Thomas Massie. The Senate voted last week on a virtually identical measure, which lawmakers in that chamber passed unanimously. Neither the House nor the Senate version of the measure explicitly mentioned Trump's comments last week that he would have to "see what happens" when asked if he would commit to a peaceful transition of power if he loses to Biden.

4. **The Trump administration is planning ICE raids and targeted arrests in "sanctuary cities" across the U.S. next month.** The raids, known informally as the "sanctuary op," could begin in California as early as this week, according to three U.S. officials. The raids would then expand to cities including Denver and Philadelphia. Two officials with knowledge of plans for the sanctuary op described it as more of a political messaging campaign than a major ICE operation.

5. **New York City's coronavirus positivity rate is the highest it's been since June.** Mayor Bill de Blasio announced at a news conference that the city now has a 3.25% positivity rate, up from 1.93% on Monday. The jump came on the first day that public elementary schools across the city reopened. The city's COVID-19 guidelines state that all public schools must shut down if the citywide seven-day positivity rate stays above 3%. Several of the spikes also occurred in Orthodox Jewish communities in South Brooklyn and Queens. City officials have threatened to introduce more severe localized lockdown measures, including restricting gatherings of more than 10 people, if outbreaks continue to occur.
