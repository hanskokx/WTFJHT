1. **Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has "repeatedly used her connections and celebrity status in China to boost the profile" of her family's shipping company**, Foremost Group, which benefits from industrial policies in China that are roiling the Trump administration. Chao has no official affiliation or stake in her family's company, but she and her husband, Mitch McConnell, have received millions of dollars in gifts from her father, who ran the company until last year.

2. **Trump called for a boycott of AT&T in order to bring "big changes" to CNN**, which is owned by the telecommunications giant. "I believe that if people stoped using or subscribing to @ATT," Trump tweeted, "they would be forced to make big changes at @CNN, which is dying in the ratings anyway." The tweet came as Trump complained that he was being forced to watch CNN as "the primary source of news available from the U.S." while in London for a state visit.

3. **The Trump administration considered imposing tariffs on imports from Australia last week**, but decided against the move after intense opposition from military and State Department officials. Some of Trump's top advisers urged him to impose the tariffs in response to a surge of Australian aluminum coming into American markets over the last year. But DOD and State Department officials warned that the move would alienate a top ally. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/02/business/trump-australia-tariffs.html))
