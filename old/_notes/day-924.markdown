1. **Trump ordered the military to punish the prosecutors who tried the case of a Navy SEAL who was charged and acquitted of war crimes in the death of a captured ISIS fighter in Iraq**. Trump complained that the prosecutors who tried the case against Eddie Gallagher "were ridiculously given a Navy Achievement Medal" and demanded that the military strip them of those medals. "I have directed the Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer & Chief of Naval Operations John Richardson to immediately withdraw and rescind the awards," Trump tweeted. "I am very happy for Eddie Gallagher and his family!" A Navy official said Spencer has the authority to rescind awards and will do so in this case.

2. **The chief internal watchdog for the nation's intelligence agencies told Senate Democrats he won't investigate how the White House handled the security clearances for Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, and other administration officials unless Trump asks him to**. "The authority over access to classified information ultimately rests with the President of the United States," Michael Atkinson said. "It is well-established that the President of the United States has broad latitude concerning the process through which security clearances are granted, transferred, or revoked." Atkinson said his office is "available and willing to conduct a review" of the clearance decisions, but only "at the request of the President or his designees." In response, the group of senators who initially called for the probe wrote a letter to Trump asking him to order an investigation.

3. **So many people have requested cash payments from Equifax in the wake of its massive 2017 data breach that the FTC is trying to persuade people to take Equifax's offer of free credit monitoring instead of a $125 settlement check**. The FTC said "millions of people" have logged into the claims website set up by the federal government following a multi-million-dollar settlement with Equifax that was announced on Monday. Using the website, consumers can file for Equifax's free credit monitoring or receive a check for up to $125, which is meant to reimburse the cost of getting credit monitoring from elsewhere, but the fund only has $31 million in it. "Frankly," the agency said in a blog post, "the free credit monitoring is worth a lot more â€” the market value would be hundreds of dollars a year."
