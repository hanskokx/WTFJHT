1. **More than 200 Russian mercenaries were killed in a clash with U.S. forces in Syria last week.** The fighters attacked a base and refinery held by the U.S. and were defeated. It is not clear whether the attack was a rogue operation or if it was ordered by Russia. Defense Secretary Mattis called the situation "perplexing."

2. **The Trump administration proposed replacing food stamps with a monthly "American Harvest Box,"** full of government-picked, nonperishable foods. The proposal was buried in the White House fiscal 2019 budget, and would include items like milk, peanut butter, canned fruits, meats and cereal. The administration claims the plan would save more than $129 billion over 10 years. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/12/food-stamps-trump-administration-343245))

3. **Trump claimed that March 5 is the "last chance" to pass DACA.** The deadline is the same one he announced last year, but a recent court ruling rendered the deadline meaningless. "Wouldn't it be great if we could finally, after so many years, solve the DACA puzzle," Trump tweeted. He added: "This will be our last chance, there will never be another opportunity! March 5th."
