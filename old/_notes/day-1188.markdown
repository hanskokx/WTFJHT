1. **Trump said he plans to sign an executive order banning immigration to the U.S.** because of "the attack from the Invisible Enemy." Trump tweeted that he will sign the executive order in order to "protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens." The announcement comes as Trump has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. is ready to be re-opened despite the continued spread of the coronavirus and a U.S. death toll in the tens of thousands. A senior administration official said the move has been "under consideration for a while," but no details about the plan or the rollout are currently available.
