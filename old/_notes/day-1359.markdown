1. **House Democrats will create a commission to review whether Trump is capable of carrying out his duties as president.** Speaker Nancy Pelosi made the announcement after expressing concerns that Trump is suffering a "disassociation from reality" and "is, shall we say, in an altered state right now." Pelosi and Rep. Jamie Raskin will hold a press conference at 10:15 a.m. ET "to discuss the introduction of the Commission on Presidential Capacity to Discharge the Powers and Duties of Office Act." Trump responded on Twitter by claiming that "Crazy Nancy is the one who should be under observation." He added: "They don’t call her Crazy for nothing!" He also retweeted Republican allies like Rep. Mark Green, who said he "wouldn't put it past Speaker Pelosi to stage a coup." The 25th amendment does allow Pelosi to create a panel to review Trump's health and fitness for office, but the House of Representatives will not be able to remove Trump from office without the consent of Mike Pence and members of Trump's cabinet.

2. **The Justice Department's review into the origins of the Russia investigation will not be released until after the election.** Attorney General Bill Barr has been telling top Republicans that U.S. Attorney John Durham's report about alleged abuses by the Obama administration and intelligence community will not result in any indictments or a public report before Nov. 3. Trump has publicly criticized Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray for not moving fast enough with Durham's inquiry, saying, "They want to get more, more, more. They keep getting more. I said, 'you don’t need any more.'" ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/barr-durham-report-election-3c02ec6a-7613-4083-b35c-4844de6da16b.html))
