1. **Trump publicly mused about whether or not injecting disinfectant into people's veins or shining "a very powerful light" inside their bodies might be a cure for coronavirus and suggested that Dr. Deborah Birx and her team were studying its efficacy.** "So supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it's ultraviolet or just a very powerful light — and I think you said that hasn't been checked because of the testing," Trump said unprompted at Thursday's coronavirus press briefing. "And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or some other way, and I think you said you're going to test that, too." He continued: "I see the disinfectant that knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning? As you see, it gets in the lungs, it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that." Medical experts, doctors, public health professionals, and the makers of Lysol issued statements rebuking Trump's comments and warning people about the dangers of injecting or ingesting disinfectants, which are highly toxic and can be deadly.

2. **The House approved a $484 billion coronavirus relief bill by a vote of 388-5-1.** The bill is the fourth relief package aimed at addressing the economic impact of the virus. The money will go toward replenishing two small business relief programs, funding hospitals, and expanding testing. The bill now heads to Trump, who has said he will probably sign it into law.
