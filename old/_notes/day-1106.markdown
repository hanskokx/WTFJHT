1. **Chief Justice John Roberts told Senators that he will not read the name of the whistleblower aloud or publicly relay any questions that might unmask the official**. Sen. Rand Paul composed questions that violated Roberts' order and was unable to ask them during the Senate impeachment trial proceedings. Paul has been floating the whistleblower's name in public for months, but Roberts is allowed to screen questions from Senators in advance before the were submitted for reading on the Senate floor.

3. **Trump's commerce secretary said the Chinese coronavirus "will help to accelerate the return of jobs" to the U.S. and North America**.

4. **The U.S. economy missed Trump's 3% growth target for the second year in a row,** with the economy growing by only 2.3% last year.
