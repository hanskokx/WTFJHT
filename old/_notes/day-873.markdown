1. **Trump ordered his aides to lie about the results of his campaign's internal polling efforts in key battleground states.** After he was briefed on the results of a 17-state poll conducted by his campaign pollster, Tony Fabrizio, Trump told aides to publicly deny that he was trailing Joe Biden in states like Texas, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. When details about the polls leaked, he also told aides to say publicly that other polling data showed him doing well.

2. **Rep. Justin Amash stepped down from the right-wing House Freedom Caucus, which he co-founded, less than a month after becoming the first Republican to admit that Trump committed impeachable offenses.** Amash said he stepped down because he "didn't want to be a further distraction for the group." After tweeting that Mueller's report contained "multiple examples" of Trump committing obstruction of justice, the conservative Michigan lawmaker took flak from Trump, who said Amash has "been a loser for a long time." Amash is now also facing a primary challenge from a Trump supporter.

3. **Mike Pence said barring U.S. embassies from flying the rainbow flag during LGBTQ Pride Month was "the right decision."** Under Obama, Pride Month guidelines left approvals up to each ambassador or chief of mission, but that changed last year when Mike Pompeo became secretary of state. Pence added that "when it comes to the American flagpole, and American embassies and capitals around the world, one American flag flies."

4. **Trump drew a distinction between himself and Richard Nixon while answering questions about the possibility of impeachment.** "He left. I donâ€™t leave," Trump said. "A big difference." ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/10/trump-impeachment-nixon-1359209))

5. **Former Trump Chief of Staff and RNC chairman Reince Preibus joined the Navy at age 47.** Preibus was sworn in as an entry-level officer by Mike Pence during a commissioning ceremony on Monday morning.
