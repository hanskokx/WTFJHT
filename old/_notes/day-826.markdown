1. **The White House informed the House Oversight Committee that Stephen Miller will not testify about his role in Trump's immigration policies.** White House counsel Pat Cipollone sent a letter to the committee and cited a "long-standing precedent" of previous administrations refusing to make White House staff available to testify on Capitol Hill. Cipollone said Cabinet secretaries and other executive branch officials would instead provide "reasonable accommodation" for requests and questions from the committee on immigration policy issues.

2. **Trump tried on multiple occasions to get Jeff Sessions to "unrecuse" himself from the Russia investigation and re-open an investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server**, according to the Mueller report. The first time was in the middle of 2017, when Trump called Sessions at home and asked him to unrecuse himself from "all of it" and go after Clinton. No evidence has emerged showing that Sessions ever acted on any of Trump's requests to have Clinton's case reopened, but he did ask a DOJ official in November 2017 to review Trump's claims about Clinton, as well as the FBI's handling of the Trump-Russia investigation. After a cabinet meeting in December 2017, Trump pulled Sessions aside and said, "I don’t know if you could unrecuse yourself. You’d be a hero. Not telling you to do anything."
