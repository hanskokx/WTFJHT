1. **Twitter added a fact-check label to two of Trump's tweets for the first time, marking them as "potentially misleading."** Trump falsely claimed on Tuesday that mail-in voting leads to widespread voter fraud. In response, Twitter added a banner notification underneath each tweet that reads, "Get the facts about mail-in ballots," and brings the user to news articles about mail-in voting and Trump's claims when clicked. Trump's tweets, according to a spokesperson for Twitter, "contain potentially misleading information about voting processes and have been labeled to provide additional context around mail-in ballots." There is no evidence that mail-in ballots result in higher rates of voter fraud.

2. **Trump threatened to shut down social media platforms that "silence "conservative voices** after Twitter labeled two of his tweets "potentially misleading." Trump tweeted that Republicans feel social media companies "totally silence conservatives voices" and threatened to "strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen."

3. **The conservative organization working to restrict voting in the 2020 election is part of a dark money network that has been helping Trump remake the U.S. federal court system.** The Honest Elections Project announced in April that it planned to spend $250,000 on advertisements warning of the dangers of mail-in voting, accusing Democrats of cheating, and using misleading data to accuse states of having bloated voter rolls while threatening them with lawsuits. HEP has also filed briefs in favor of voting restrictions in several states and is often represented by the same law firm that represents Trump. Despite presenting itself as a distinct entity, HEP is actually just a legal alias for the Judicial Election Project, a conservative group that has played an instrumental role in Trump's unprecedented effort to reshape the federal judiciary by appointing scores of conservative judges.

4. **White House counsel Pat Cipollone failed to explain why Trump removed inspectors general for the intelligence community and the State Department in a letter sent to GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley**. Grassley demanded an explanation for the removals, but said the letter from Cipollone "failed to address" the congressional requirement that there "ought to be a good reason" for the dismissals of State Department IG Steve Linick and Intelligence Community IG Michael Atkinson. Instead of providing an explanation for the dismissals, Cipollone's letter simply emphasized Trump's "constitutional right and duty" to remove inspectors general when he "loses confidence" in them. "I don't dispute the president's authority under the Constitution," Grassley said in his response, "but without sufficient explanation, it's fair to question the president's rationale for removing an inspector general. If the president has a good reason to remove an inspector general, just tell Congress what it is."

5. **Antibody tests used to identify those who have been infected with the coronavirus in the past might be wrong up to half the time**, according to the CDC. New guidance from the CDC says the results from antibody test are not accurate enough to be used to make important policy decisions, including "decisions about grouping persons residing in or being admitted to congregate settings, such as schools, dormitories, or correctional facilities." The guidance also says the results should not be used to make "decisions about returning persons to the workplace."
