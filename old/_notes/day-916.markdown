3. **The Freedom Caucus formally urged Trump to reject the bipartisan spending deal and agreement to raise the debt ceiling**. The conservative group cited concerns about the impact the deal will have on the national debt as the main reason for their opposition. "Our country is undeniably headed down a path of fiscal insolvency and rapidly approaching $23 trillion in debt," the group said in a statement. "All sides should go back to the drawing board and work around the clock, canceling recess if necessary, on a responsible budget agreement that serves American taxpayers better—not a $323 billion spending frenzy with no serious offsets."

4. **The Justice Department opened a broad new antitrust investigation into major U.S. tech companies to determine whether the companies have hurt competition, suppressed innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers**. The probe will include a focus on "widespread concerns" about social media, search engines, and online retail services. "Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition," the DOJ's chief antitrust officer said in a statement, "digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands. The Department’s antitrust review will explore these important issues." ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/90b8142ea4b84910a5cd4ad1923fa70b))
