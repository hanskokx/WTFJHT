*WTF Just Happened Today may (or may not!) be taking a holiday break until the end of the year. It depends on Trump and this shutdown. If there's nothing to report, there's nothing to report, and WTFJHT will take the day off accordingly. Regardless, WTFJHT won't publish on Christmas Day or New Year's Day. Check back for updates, [subscribe to the newsletter](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/subscribe/), and follow [Current Status](https://currentstatus.io/) until further notice.*
