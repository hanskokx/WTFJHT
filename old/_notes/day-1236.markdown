1. **Trump announced that he has ordered National Guard troops to begin withdrawing from the streets of Washington, D.C. "now that everything is under perfect control."** Trump warned that the troops "will be going home, but can quickly return, if needed." The move comes amid a barrage of constant criticism over Trump's violent response to mostly peaceful protests across the city and his threats to further militarize the government's response to nationwide demonstrations against police brutality and the murder of George Floyd.

2. **Top Pentagon officials ordered the National Guard to use Black Hawk helicopters and combat-style "persistent presence" tactics to disperse protesters in Washington D.C. last week.** Army secretary Ryan McCarthy ordered two National Guard helicopters to fly low over groups of protesters and use the downward blast from their rotor blades to force people on the ground to take cover as signs were ripped from the sides of buildings. The pilots from one of the helicopters have been grounded pending the outcome of an inquiry into the incident. Military officials said the Guard used the tactics after the Pentagon threatened to send in active duty rapid-response units from the 82nd Airborne Division if they were unable to handle the situation on their own.

3. **Trump demanded that the military deploy 10,000 troops onto U.S. streets during a heated argument with White House officials in the Oval Office last week.** Trump reportedly faced opposition from Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, and AG William Barr. A senior U.S. official said Trump eventually eased his demands after National Guard troops were deployed and Esper recommended that they preposition — but not deploy — active duty soldiers from the 82nd Airborne and other units to the D.C. area. "Having active duty forces available but not in the city was enough for the president for the time," said the official.

4. **Bill Barr defended his decision to have D.C. police violently clear out a crowd of peaceful protesters from Lafayette Park last week** so Trump could have his picture taken in front of a church across the street from the White House. Barr also defended his decision to have police use tear gas and so-called "less lethal" projectiles against the group of peaceful protesters, whom Barr claimed "were not peaceful." Barr also claimed that no chemical irritants were used to clear the crowd. "Pepper spray is not a chemical irritant," Barr said. "It’s not chemical." The CDC specifically classifies pepper spray as a form of tear gas, and a spokesperson for the Park Police later admitted that it was a "mistake" for them to have claimed officers didn’t use tear gas on the scene.

5. **White House officials are debating a plan to have Trump address the nation this week and give a speech on issues related to race and national unity.** Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson suggested during an interview that Trump would address the killing of George Floyd and the tensions his death exposed. "I think you're going to be hearing from the President this week on this topic in some detail," Carson said. "And I would ask you maybe to reserve judgment until after that time."

6. poll/ **80% of American voters say that things are out of control in the United States, while 15% say things are under control.** 59% say they're more troubled by Floyd's death and the actions of police than they are about recent protests or occasional looting, compared to 27% who are more concerned about the protests.
