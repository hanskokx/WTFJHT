1. **The Trump campaign is considering holding a political event on White House grounds near Election Day.** Trump was criticized for using the venue as a political prop during the Republican National Convention, but he was reportedly so happy with how things went that he wants to do it again, according to two people familiar with the planning. One option under consideration would be for Trump to hold a victory party with supporters on election night. Another option is a rally-style event at the White House on the night before the election. No final decision has been made and plans could still change, the people said.

2. **A federal court rejected the Trump administration's request to exclude undocumented immigrants from being counted in the U.S. Census.** A special three-judge panel in New York ruled that the move would violate the statute governing congressional apportionment because it runs afoul of a statute saying apportionment must be based on everyone who is a resident of the United States. The judges found that Trump's July 21 memorandum was "an unlawful exercise of the authority granted to the President," and that all residents must be counted for apportionment purposes regardless of their legal status.

3. **Trump held six indoor rallies after admitted to Bob Woodward on Feb. 7 that he knew the coronavirus "goes through air" and is more deadly than "even your strenuous flus."** In the interview, Trump told Woodward, "It goes through air, Bob," adding, "you just breathe the air and that's how it's passed." Yet Trump participated in rallies in New Hampshire on February 10, Arizona on February 19, Colorado on February 20, Nevada on February 21, South Carolina on February 28, and North Carolina on March 2. No social distancing measures were implemented for those rallies. ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-rallies-after-coronavirus-airborne/))

4. **Trump falsely claimed at a rally in Michigan that he had revitalized the auto manufacturing industry in the state.** In fact, the industry had actually lost jobs even before the coronavirus pandemic hit the state in March. "We brought you a lot of car plants, we brought you a lot ... and we’re going to bring you a lot more," Trump told the crowd. Only one new major assembly facility — a Jeep plant on Detroit's east side — has been announced during Trump's term, and two General Motors plants in Michigan were idled by the company last year. Trump also said that after speaking with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, officials announced "five new car companies are coming to Michigan," but no such announcement has been made. More than 5,000 Michiganders attended the rally at an aircraft hanger in Freeland, MI, most of whom were not wearing masks.

5. **A group of 14 states asked a federal judge to reverse service cuts and changes at the U.S. Postal Service.** The states filed a motion in the U.S. District Court in Yakima, Washington asking Judge Stanley A. Bastian to order USPS to treat election mail, including ballots and registration forms, as First Class mail and to ensure it is delivered promptly. The states also asked the judge to end the "leave behind" policy, which requires that postal trucks leave at certain times, irrespective of whether or not there is additional mail to load. They also asked the judge to order USPS to replace or reinstall any removed sorting machines needed to ensure timely processing.
