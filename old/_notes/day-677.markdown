1. **Robert Mueller said in a court filing that Paul Manafort violated his cooperation agreement by repeatedly lying to federal investigators**, relieving the special counsel's office of all the promises made to Manafort in his plea agreement. Defense attorneys for Manafort say the opposite is true, and that Manafort "believes he has provided truthful information." Both sides agreed that U.S. District Court Judge Amy Jackson should set a sentencing date as soon as possible. The apparent collapse of Manafort's plea deal means he could now face at least a decade in prison after pleading guilty in September to charges of tax fraud, violating foreign lobbying laws, and attempting to obstruct justice.

2. **House Republicans are meeting with Trump today in an attempt to avoid a government shutdown on Dec. 7.** Republican leaders promised Trump that they would fight to secure more funding for Trump's border wall after the midterms, but Democrats say they've already committed to $1.6 billion in funding for the wall and Trump's $5 billion price tag is too high. Senate GOP leaders have discussed the possibility of spreading the $5 billion out over two years. Trump hasn't ruled the idea out, but it's not clear whether Democrats will concede.

3. **Democratic candidate TJ Cox now leads Republican incumbent David Valadao in the country's last remaining undecided congressional race.** If Cox wins, the Democrats will have picked up seven House seats in California and 40 House seats countrywide. Cox was behind by almost 4,400 votes on election night, but he has since pulled ahead by 436 votes.

4. **House Republicans unveiled a sweeping, nearly 300-page new tax plan that they hope to pass during the lame-duck session.** The bill would impact Americans' retirement savings, multiple business tax breaks, and would redesign the IRS. The bill was written by the outgoing chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives tax committee, and is seen as the opening salvo in negotiations with the Senate. House Republicans may vote on the proposal as early as this week.
