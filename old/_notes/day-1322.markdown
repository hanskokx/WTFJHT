1. **Congressional investigators uncovered more than $1 billion dollars in potential waste and fraud in the Paycheck Protection Program.** The money went to companies that "double dipped" and received multiple in violation of the program's rules, according to a preliminary analysis by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis. The report says there is a "high risk that PPP loans may have been diverted from small businesses truly in need to ineligible businesses or even to criminals." The subcommittee found more than 10,000 loans in which the borrowers obtained more than one loan. Because the Trump administration decided to only audit loans for more than $2 million, only 65 of the loans would otherwise have been subject to additional review. More than 600 loans totaling nearly $100 million went to companies that are barred or suspended from doing business with the federal government. More than 350 loans worth roughly $200 million went to government contractors that had been flagged by the federal government for performance or integrity issues. More than 11,000 additional borrowers had other red flags of various types.

2. **Melania Trump repeatedly used a private email account while in the White House, according to her senior adviser and friend.** Stephanie Winston Wolkoff says she corresponded multiple times per day with Melania, and that "Melania and I both didnâ€™t use White House emails." Melania apparently used a private Trump Organization email address from the MelaniaTrump.com domain.

3. **The Federal Emergency Management Agency will no longer reimburse states for the cost of cloth face coverings at non-emergency settings, including schools, public housing and courthouses.** The policy change will go into effect on Sept. 15.
