1. **The Trump administration released a $4.8 trillion budget proposal that includes cuts to major domestic and safety net programs**. The proposal would cut Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program and drain savings from Medicare, despite Trump's promises that he would protect Medicare and Social Security. It also slashes the EPA's budget by 26.5% and the Health and Human Services budget — which includes the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Protection — by 9% over the next year. The Department of Education would see an almost 8% cut, the Interior Department would be cut by 13.4%, and Housing and Urban Development would be cut by 15.2%. Trump would increase funding to the Department of Homeland Security and leave the Pentagon's budget at current levels, while adding 12% to NASA's budget. Even if all the proposed cuts are approved by Congress, the budget would still fail to eliminate the federal deficit over the next 10 years.

2. **Chuck Schumer called on every government agency inspector general to investigate retaliation against whistleblowers who report presidential misconduct — including the firing on Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman from the National Security Council**. Schumer set letters to 74 inspectors general after Trump fired Vindman from the NSC because of his testimony in the impeachment trial. Amb. Gordon Sondland was also recalled from his post as a result of his participation in the inquiry. Schumer said the firings were "part of a dangerous, growing pattern of retaliation against those who report wrongdoing only to find themselves targeted by the President and subject to his wrath and vindictiveness."

* **A handful of Republican senators tried to stop Trump from firing Gordon Sondland, but Trump did it anyway**. The senators were concerned that it would look bad for Trump to fire him, especially since Sondland was already expected to leave after the impeachment trial was over.

1. **Billionaire conservative casino owner Sheldon Adelson is planning to donate at least $100 million to Trump's re-election campaign and Republican congressional election efforts in 2020**. Adelson and his wife have donated more than $100 million to Super PACs and dark money groups in each of the last two presidential election cycles, and could end up donating more than $200 million in 2020.
