1. **The Treasury Department has ordered Trump's name to be printed on the IRS stimulus checks that are being sent out to tens of millions of Americans.** It will be the first time a president's name will appear on an IRS funding disbursement. Trump has privately asked Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to let him formally sign the checks, but the president is not an authorized signer for legal disbursements by the U.S. Treasury. The unprecedented decision to add Trump's name to the checks could slow their delivery by at least a few days, according to a senior IRS official, although other officials disputed that the checks would be delayed.

2. **Trump announced the formation of his "Opening the Country" council, which includes dozens of high-profile business and labor leaders who will advise him on when and how to restart the U.S. economy.** Trump said he plans to speak with chief executives at JPMorgan Chase, Blackstone, Apple, Facebook, the New England Patriots, and the National Basketball Association, among others, about joining the advisory council. "I’m tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old," Trump said. "But I haven’t actually had too much time to watch." Trump did not confirm whether or not the people on his list had actually agreed to serve on the council. Some business leaders have reportedly been hesitant to tie their names and their companies to the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic and to a new advisory council with no clear roster or mandate.

3. **Trump announced that he will be "authorizing" governors of individual states to reopen their economies.** "I will be speaking to all 50 governors very shortly," Trump said. "And I will then be authorizing each individual governor of each individual state to implement a reopening, very powerful reopening plan of their estate in a time in a manner which is most appropriate." Trump previously claimed that only he had the "total authority" as president to decide whether states could reopen their economies or if they are to remain under strict social distancing guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

4. **Trump announced that the U.S. will place a hold on all funding to the World Health Organization in response to the WHO's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.** The hold will remain for up to 90 days while the Trump administration conducts a funding review. Trump accused the WHO of "severely mismanaging and covering up" the crisis and said the U.S. has "a duty to insist on full accountability." Trump also said that "if we cannot trust them" then the U.S. will be "forced to find other ways to work with other nations to achieve public health goals." The U.S. is the largest donor to the WHO, and contributes between $400 million and $500 million a year to the organization, which has an annual budget of around $6 billion.
