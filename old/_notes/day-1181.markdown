1. **Trump interrupted his daily coronavirus press briefing to play a heavily-edited, campaign-style highlight reel of video clips and soundbites praising himself and the steps his administration has taken to combat the virus over the last four months**. Trump prefaced the video by lashing out at the New York Times and calling it a "fake newspaper." Trump presented the video as his response to a recent report in the Times that revealed he wasted several weeks doing nothing to prevent the spread of the virus throughout the United States, despite several warnings and calls to action from senior U.S. officials and public health experts. While the video played, Trump grinned and pointed to the screen when he saw clips of himself speaking. CNN stopped its live coverage of the task force press briefing and accused Trump of playing "a propaganda video at taxpayer expense in the White House briefing room." Trump later told reporters his staff made the video two hours before the briefing began.
