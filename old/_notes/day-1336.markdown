1. **Trump criticized Joe Biden for not implementing a national mask mandate, even though Biden is not the president and has no authority to do so.** Trump was responding to a question at an ABC News town hall about why he doesn't support universal mask-wearing and why he doesn't wear a mask more often. "A good question is, you ask, like Joe Biden," Trump said. "They said, 'We're going to do a national mandate on masks.' But he didn't do it, I mean, he never did it." Trump was referring to a policy promise that Biden made last month as part of his plan to combat the pandemic if he is elected, but Biden has since walked back the idea and instead says he would encourage governors to do so and lead by example by wearing face coverings publicly.

2. **Trump again defended his claim that the coronavirus will "disappear" even without a vaccine.** Trump said the U.S. would eventually develop "herd mentality" — the proper term is "herd immunity," which occurs when enough individuals develop immunity to prevent the spread of a disease. "With time it goes away," Trump said during an ABC News town hall. "You'll develop, you'll develop herd — like a herd mentality. It's going to be, it’s going to be herd-developed, and that's going to happen. That will all happen." Trump later insisted that the U.S. is "rounding the corner" when it comes to the virus, even as the U.S. death toll approaches 200,000 people.

3. **Nancy Pelosi called for an immediate investigation into allegations of "high rates of hysterectomies done to immigrant women" held inside an ICE detention facility in Georgia.** A whistleblower complaint details what is described as "jarring medical neglect" at the Irwin County Detention Center. In a statement, Pelosi called on the Department of Homeland Security to "immediately investigate" the allegations in the complaint and said Americans "need to know why and under what conditions so many women, reportedly without their informed consent, were pushed to undergo this extremely invasive and life-altering procedure." The complaint also alleges that the ICE facility refused to test detainees who had been exposed to the coronavirus or those who showed symptoms of COVID-19.
