1. **The White House economic adviser said the Trump administration wants to end federal subsidies and tax credits for electric cars and renewable energy sources.** Larry Kudlow predicted that the subsidies would be gone within the next few years. "It’s just all going to end in the near future," Kudlow said. "I don’t know whether it will end in 2020 or 2021." ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-autos-idUSKBN1O22D4))

2. **Robert Mueller is expected to recommend a sentence for Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn.**  Mueller's recommendation will come in the form of a court filing, which is also expected to include more details about the extent of Flynn's cooperation with the special counsel in the Russia probe. Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia. He will be sentenced by a federal judge on Dec. 18.

3. **Paul Manafort tried to get Ecuador to hand over Julian Assange in exchange for debt relief from the United States.** Manafort originally flew to Ecuador in May 2017 to convince then-incoming President Lenín Moreno to let Manafort broker an energy deal between China and Ecuador. But the talks shifted to Ecuador's desire to rid itself of Assange, who has been staying the Ecuadorean embassy in London since 2012. Manafort suggested that he could negotiate a deal for the handover of Assange, but the deal quickly fell apart once it became clear that Manafort was a major target of Mueller's Russia investigation. There is no evidence that Trump was aware of or involved in Manafort's dealings with Ecuador.

4. **Michael Avenatti will not run for president in 2020 after all.** "After consultation with my family and at their request, I have decided not to seek the Presidency of the United States in 2020," Avenatti said. "I will continue to represent Stormy Daniels and others against Donald Trump and his cronies and will not rest until Trump is removed from office, and our republic and its values are restored."
