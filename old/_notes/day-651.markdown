1. **Trump: "We have to have a wall of people" on the border to prevent a group of migrants and refugees from crossing into the United States.** Trump's comments came shortly after it was announced that he wants to deploy an additional 10,000 to 15,000 troops to the southern border.

2. **Trump: "I always want to tell the truth."** During the same interview, he lied about the group of migrants traveling north through Central America, claiming that the group is "a lot larger than it’s reported" and that he is "pretty good at estimating crowd sizes." He also claimed that the group is made up of "mostly young men," and that the group has been intentionally "pushing the women . . . and the kids right up to the front" in order to elicit sympathy from observers.

3. **Trump suggested that he might invoke a state of national emergency in order to justify using the military to arrest and detain migrants and refugees at the southern border.** When asked what role active duty military personnel would play, since U.S. law prohibits the U.S. Army from being used to enforce domestic law, Trump said "Well it depends, it depends." He continued: "National emergency covers a lot of territory. They can’t invade our country. You look at that it almost looks like an invasion. It’s almost does look like an invasion."

4. **Trump claimed that calling the press the "enemy of the people" is his only way to fight back "when people write stories about me that are so wrong."** He said he thinks he's "doing a service" by attacking the press, and that he wouldn't have been elected if he hadn't done it during the 2016 campaign. "If they would write accurately about me," he continued, "I would be the nicest president you've ever seen. It would be much easier."
