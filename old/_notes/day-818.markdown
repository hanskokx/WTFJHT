1. **Attorney General William Barr issued an order that directs immigration judges to deny some migrants a chance to post bail after being detained.** The order could keep thousands of migrants in jail indefinitely while they wait for a resolution to their asylum claims. The order represents the latest effort by the Trump administration to reduce the number of migrants who are able to receive protection from violence and poverty by obtaining legal status from the United States. The decision means DHS will have the sole authority to decide whether to release people who crossed the border illegally and later claimed asylum.

2. **Trump claimed that his supporters were prevented from attending a Fox News town hall with Bernie Sanders.** Trump, without providing evidence, tweeted that "many Trump Fans & Signs were outside of the @FoxNews Studio last night" who had "big complaints about not being let in."
