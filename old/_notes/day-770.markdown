1. **Robert Mueller corrected part of a previous allegation that Paul Manafort lied about his contacts with his Russian business associate, Konstantin Kilimnik.** Mueller cited new evidence obtained less than two weeks ago from Trump's former deputy campaign manager, Rick Gates, which appears to suggest that Mueller made a mistake with one of his accusations against Manafort. Mueller's recently revised court filing says the revision should not change the ruling by Judge Amy Berman Jackson that Manafort lied about his interactions with Kilimnik because they have presented enough additional evidence to support the underlying allegation.

2. **Trump and Kim Jong-Un abruptly ended their summit in Vietnam after negotiations over North Korea's nuclear disarmament collapsed.** The two leaders were unable to agree on any steps toward denuclearization or any measures to ease tensions between North and South Korea. Trump said the main issue was the sanctions, which Kim wanted Trump to remove entirely. "We had some options," Trump said, "but at this time we decided not to do any of the options." He added, "Sometimes you have to walk, and this was just one of those times."

3. **Roger Stone disputed Michael Cohen's claims that Stone and Trump discussed WikiLeaks' forthcoming DNC email dump in July 2016, saying "Mr. Cohen's statement is not true."** Stone's "statement" on Cohen's testimony, which came in the form of a single text message sent to BuzzFeed News, did not indicate which part of Cohen's testimony was false. Stone is currently under a gag order not to publicly comment on his case or Robert Mueller's investigation, including any "participants" in his case or the investigation.

4. **GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz says he "personally apologized" to Michael Cohen after he publicly threatened to reveal information about Cohen's alleged "girlfriends" in a tweet sent shortly before Cohen's testimony.** "Iâ€™ve personally apologized to @MichaelCohen212 4 referencing his private family in the public square," Gaetz tweeted. "Regardless of disagreements, family members should be off-limits from attacks ... Let's leave the Cohen family alone." The Florida Bar Association is currently investigating Gaetz's original threat as a possible violation of its rules of professionalism.
