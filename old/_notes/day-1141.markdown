1. **The International Criminal Court ruled that its chief prosecutor could open an investigation into allegations of U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan.** The U.S. is not a party to the Rome Statute, the court's founding document, and does not recognize the ICC's jurisdiction. The ruling marks the first time the ICC has authorized an investigation into American forces in the 15 years since it was formed to seek justice for victims of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. The ICC says it has gathered enough evidence to prove that U.S. forces "committed acts of torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, rape and sexual violence" in 2003 and 2004, and later at CIA black sites in Poland, Romania and Lithuania.

2. **Trump inadvertently confirmed one of the Mueller report’s key findings about his efforts to obstruct justice when he reacted to Jeff Sessions' failure to obtain a majority vote in his Alabama Senate primary race.** Trump tweeted about Sessions' second-place finish in Tuesday’s Republican primary and wrote, "This is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed Attorney General of the United States & then doesn’t have the wisdom or courage to stare down & end the phony Russia Witch Hunt." He added: "Recuses himself on FIRST DAY in office, and the Mueller Scam begins!" Presidents are not supposed to direct their attorney general to end specific investigations, especially when they directly involve their own campaign. The perception that Trump had done so was the very thing that led to Mueller's appointment as special prosecutor in the first place.

3. **A federal appeals court temporarily blocked the Trump administration's "Remain in Mexico" policy** that calls for asylum-seekers to stay in the country while they await the results of their court cases in California and Arizona. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco stopped the administration from enforcing the policy unless the Supreme Court gets involved before March 12. The ruling only applies to California and Arizona, however, not New Mexico and Texas. The court initially ruled last week that the policy should be halted along the entire southern U.S. border, but the White House pushed back and asked for the policy to remain in effect until next week to provide time for the Supreme Court to decide.
