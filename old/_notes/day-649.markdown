1. **Trump is planning to end U.S. birthright citizenship.** He plans to sign an executive order that he claims will end the right to U.S. citizenship for babies born in America if the babies' parents are not already U.S. citizens. "We’re the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States," Trump said, "with all of those benefits... It’s ridiculous. It’s ridiculous. And it has to end." He continued: It's in the process. It'll happen ... with an executive order."

2. **Fewer than 1,000 U.S. defense jobs would be created as a result of Trump's latest $110 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia**, despite Trump's constant claims that the deal would create "500,000 jobs." One forecast shows the potential for up to 10,000 new jobs in Saudi Arabia, while keeping 18,000 existing U.S. workers busy, but experts say it is unlikely.

3. **Trump called Florida's Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum a "thief" who runs a corrupt city.** Trump provided no evidence to support that claim, or his claim that Gillum was under investigation by the FBI. The Tallahassee city government, where Gillum is mayor, is currently being investigated, but there is no evidence that Gillum is personally under scrutiny, nor has he been charged with any wrongdoing.

4. **Protesters interrupted Jeff Sessions during a Federalist Society event touting his work on religious liberty.** One man dressed as a member of the clergy stood up in the middle of Sessions' remarks and began reciting a Bible verse about taking in strangers and helping people in need before calling on Sessions to "repent." The protesters were escorted out of the building by police and Sessions said, "Thank you for your comments and your attacks."
