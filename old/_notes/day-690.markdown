1. **Trump told James Mattis to submit a $750 billion defense budget proposal for the 2020 fiscal year.** Trump previously called for a reduction in defense spending, but now he appears to have reversed course. Mattis and other top military leaders have been fighting to preserve the current $733 billion proposal, and Trump has called for a top line of $716 billion and even $700 billion as recently as October.

2. **Nick Ayers declined Trump's offer to take over for John Kelly as his chief of staff.** Ayers currently serves as Mike Pence's chief of staff, and said that he is instead leaving the administration entirely at the end of the year to spend more time with his family in Georgia. Trump didn't appear to have an obvious second choice lined up, but some believe he is eyeing North Carolina Republican Mark Meadows, who serves as the chairman of the far-right House Freedom Caucus.

3. **Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have shifted their focus from Michael Cohen's crimes to the role of Trump Organization executives in those crimes.** Cohen pleaded guilty in August to campaign finance violations and other crimes and has assisted prosecutors in their investigation. Cohen told prosecutors that the Trump Organization's CFO was involved in discussions about hush money payments made to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougall, on which prosecutors are now focusing. Now, prosecutors have renewed their requests for documents and other materials related to those payments.

4. **Conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi filed a new lawsuit against Robert Mueller**, accusing him of violating the constitution, leaking grand jury secrets, and blackmailing Corsi in order to get him to lie as part of a "legal coup d'etat" against Trump. Corsi is asking for $100 million in actual damages and $250 million in punitive damages as compensation for injury to his reputation. The suit also accuses the CIA, FBI, and NSA of placing Corsi under illegal surveillance "at the direction of Mueller and his partisan Democrat, leftist, and ethically and legally conflicted prosecutorial staff."

5. **Russian nationals interacted with a total of 14 Trump associates during the campaign and transition period**, according to public records and interviews. Some offered to help Trump's campaign or real estate business, while others offered dirt on Hillary Clinton. The contacts and communications occurred amidst "sustained efforts by the Russian government to interfere with the U.S. presidential election," according to Mueller's latest filing.
