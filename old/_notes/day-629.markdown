1. **The Trump administration is planning to take down healthcare.gov for maintenance during the sign-up period for the Affordable Care Act.** The administration did the same thing last year and drew criticism for it, but officials say the maintenance periods happen every year and are designed to occur during the slowest periods.

2. **The Roger Stone aide who is challenging the constitutionality of Robert Mueller's probe says he feels "great" about taking his case to the Supreme Court now that Brett Kavanaugh is an associate justice on the bench.** Andrew Miller worked for Stone and was subpoenaed to testify before the special counsel's grand jury. Instead, he filed suit to invalidate Mueller's authority to act as a prosecutor. A federal judge ruled against him and held him in contempt, so he appealed to ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

3. **House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy will introduce legislation this week to fully fund Trump's border wall, which will cost $23.4 billion dollars.** The bill is currently in draft form, but it is expected to be released within the next few days. The House would not be able to consider the bill until after the midterm elections. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/10/politics/kevin-mccarthy-border-wall-bill/index.html))
