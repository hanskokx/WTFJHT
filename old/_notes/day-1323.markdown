1. **Trump encouraged people in North Carolina to vote twice — once by mail and once in person — which is a felony.** When asked whether he has confidence in the mail-in system in North Carolina, Trump said to "let them send it in and let them go vote, and if their system's as good as they say it is, then obviously they won't be able to vote." He added: "If it's as good as they say it is, then obviously they won't be able to vote. If it isn't tabulated, they'll be able to vote. So that's the way it is. And that's what they should do." Voting twice in the same election is illegal under both state and federal law.

2. **The Trump campaign and the RNC sued Montana in federal court to block the expansion of mail-in voting across the state.** Gov. Steve Bullock issued a directive last month allowing counties to expand voting by mail and early voting "at their local discretion," including mailing ballots to qualified voters. The lawsuit argues that the procedures Montana has in place could allow for fraud and would dilute legitimate votes. Last month, the Trump campaign sued New Jersey and Nevada for planning to send mail-in ballots to all state voters. Bullock said in a statement that mail-in voting in Montana is "safe, secure, and was requested by a bipartisan coalition of Montana election officials seeking to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and keep Montanans safe and healthy."

3. **Trump signed a memo directing federal officials to find ways to cut federal funding to Democratic-led cities that the Trump administration has deemed "lawless" and "anarchist."** In the memo, Trump claims "Anarchy has recently beset some of our states and cities," and declares that his administration "will not allow federal tax dollars to fund cities that allow themselves to deteriorate into lawless zones." Trump cited violence amid protests against systemic racism and police brutality as the cause for the move. The memo compels Attorney General William Barr to develop a list of jurisdictions that "permitted violence and the destruction of property to persist and have refused to undertake reasonable measures to counteract these criminal activities" within the next 14 days.

4. poll/ **52% of likely voters support Biden, while 42% support Trump.** 50% of likely voters say having Trump as president makes them feel less safe, while 35% say it makes them feel more safe, and 14% say it doesn't have any impact on how they feel.
