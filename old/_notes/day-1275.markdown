1. **The U.S. set another world record with more than 75,600 new coronavirus cases in a single day on Thursday.** It marks the 11th time in the past month that the record has been broken. The previous single-day record, 68,241 cases, was announced last Friday. As of Wednesday, the seven-day average case number in the U.S. exceeded 63,000, up from around 22,200 a month ago.

2. **More than 25 U.S. states have now issued statewide mask mandates.** Face coverings will also be required at stores like Walmart, Target, and CVS, as well as in a number of Republican-led states where governors previously resisted issuing mask requirements. A handful of other states are also requiring visitors from high-infection areas to quarantine for at least 14 days upon arrival.

3. **Sen. Dianne Feinstein says she will introduce an amendment to the Senate's next coronavirus relief stimulus bill that would withhold federal funding from states that don't require residents to wear masks in public.** "Wearing masks in public should be mandatory. Period," Feinstein said. "My hope has been that other governors would show the leadership to institute their own mask mandates, but so far that hasn’t happened. It’s time for Congress to step in." 22 states currently have not issued statewide mask mandates for public settings.

4. **White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters that "the science should not stand in the way" of sending American children back to school in the fall.** McEnany stressed that when Trump says he wants schools to open, "he means open and full, kids being able to attend each and every day at their school." She then claimed that "the science is on our side" and said the administration is continues to encourage municipalities and states to "just simply follow the science, open our schools." Research from the Kaiser Family Foundation, however, found that one in four teachers risk becoming seriously ill if they contract COVID-19, and that around 3 million people over the age of 65 live in a household with a school-age child.
