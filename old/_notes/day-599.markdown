1. **Federal prosecutors admitted that they wrongly accused Maria Butina of offering to trade sex in order to infiltrate Republican circles on behalf of the Russian government.** Butina is a Russian citizen who is currently in custody and facing charges of conspiracy and illegally acting as a foreign agent.

3. **John Bolton plans to threaten the International Criminal Court in The Hague with sanctions and other penalties if it proceeds with an investigation into alleged war crimes committed by Americans in Afghanistan.** "The United States will use any means necessary to protect our citizens and those of our allies from unjust prosecution by this illegitimate court," reads a draft of Bolton's upcoming speech. The Trump administration is also expected to announce the closure of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) office in Washington due to concerns over Palestinian attempts to convince the ICC to launch an investigation into Israel.

4. **Florida GOP gubernatorial candidate Rep. Ron DeSantis spoke four times at conferences organized by a racist conservative activist.** DeSantis appeared at conferences organized by David Horowitz, who has said that black people owe their freedom to white people and that the "only serious race war" in the U.S. is being waged against whites. "David has done such great work and I’ve been an admirer," DeSantis said during a speech in 2015 at one of the events. "I’ve been to these conferences in the past but I’ve been a big admirer of an organization that shoots straight, tells the American people the truth and is standing up for the right thing."
