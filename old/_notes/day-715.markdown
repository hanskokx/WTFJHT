1. **U.S. employers added 312,000 jobs in December.** The unemployment rate went up to 3.9 percent, and the average hourly pay rose by 3.2 percent from a year ago and 0.4 percent since the previous month. The slight uptick in the unemployment rate is seen as an increase in job seekers, a positive signal.

2. **Trump blamed the recent stock market sell-off on the fact that the Democrats took control of the House.** Trump previously blamed Democrats in October for market turbulence. He has also blamed the Federal Reserve or a "glitch" for recent troubles with the stock market, while claiming credit when stocks are up.

3. **House Democrats filed a motion to intervene in a federal court case out of Texas that poses a threat to the Affordable Care Act.** A Texas judge ruled last month that the ACA is unconstitutional without the individual mandate, which Congress effectively eliminated by reducing the penalty to $0, which started this year. Since the Trump administration is not defending the ACA, a coalition of Democratic states is appealing the judge's ruling. The move to intervene is largely symbolic, however, and critics say lawmakers would be better off simply passing new legislation to address the issues in the lawsuit.
