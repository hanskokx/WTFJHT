1. **Lindsey Graham is refusing to read any of the transcripts released this week as part of the House impeachment inquiry, even though he demanded that they be made public**. Graham said he has "written the whole \[impeachment\] process off" as "a bunch of B.S." Graham also downplayed Gordon Sondland's revised testimony, during which Sondland acknowledged that he told a Ukrainian official that the release of U.S. military aid to Ukraine would "likely not occur" unless Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky publicly announced an investigation into Joe Biden and his son. Last month, however, Graham said, "If you could show me that, you know, Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo, outside the phone call, that would be very disturbing." Yesterday, Graham reiterated his blanket defense of Trump, adding: "I don't think the president did anything wrong."

2. **Mitch McConnell said the Senate would acquit Trump if an impeachment trial were held today**. "If it were today," he said, "I don’t think there’s any question — it would not lead to a removal." McConnell also warned that the longer the impeachment process takes, the longer presidential candidates who are also senators would have to spend on the Senate floor instead on the campaign trail for the 2020 presidential election. McConnell has yet to speak with Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer about how the Senate would handle an impeachment trial, but he said they would likely model the trial off the Clinton impeachment.

3. **Senate Republicans are privately discussing whether to use the impeachment inquiry into Trump to scrutinize Joe Biden and his son, Hunter**. Some of Trump's allies want to call Biden and his son to testify as witnesses in the inquiry, while others are worried that the move could prove too politically risky and lead to unintended consequences. Specifically, one group of GOP lawmakers wants to counter the Democrat's scrutiny of Trump with their own inquiry into Hunter Biden's dealings in Ukraine and China. Sens. Rand Paul and John Kennedy first raised the idea at a private lunch last week to summon Hunter Biden to testify, and Paul reiterated that call publicly at a rally in Kentucky on Monday.

4. **Trump promised "unwavering support" for Kiev in a May 29 letter congratulating newly-elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on his electoral victory**. The letter also includes an invitation to the White House, held up as a sign of the United States' enduring "commitment" to Ukraine. The letter was sent before the U.S. withheld nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine unless Zelensky agreed to publicly announce investigations into Trump's political rivals.
