1. **Trump refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the election in November.** "Well, we're going to have to see what happens," Trump said. "You know that I've been complaining very strongly about the ballots, and the ballots are a disaster." He continued: "We'll want to have — get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very — we'll have a very peaceful — there won't be a transfer, frankly. There'll be a continuation." Trump appeared to be referring to mail-in ballots, which he has repeatedly attacked as widely fraudulent, despite providing no evidence to support his claims. In June, Trump was asked whether he would accept the results of the election and he said he would "have to see," before claiming that mail-in voting would "rig the election."

2. **Trump claimed that the White House has the authority to overrule the FDA if it makes the standards for authorization of a COVID-19 vaccine more rigorous.** Trump said any attempt by the FDA to do so would be "a political move" that "has to be approved by the White House." He added: "We may or may not approve it." Generally speaking, agency guidelines do go through the White House Office of Management and Budget review process. FDA commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn, however, specifically promised the Senate Health Committee that the "will not authorize or approve any COVID-19 vaccine before it has met the agency's rigorous expectations for safety and effectiveness." He also said that the FDA "will not permit any pressure from anyone to change that." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/23/politics/trump-fda-coronavirus-vaccine/index.html))
