1. **The White House asked Navy officials to move the USS John S. McCain "out of sight" ahead of Trump's visit to Japan.** A Navy official confirmed that someone in the White House sent a message to service officials asking to move the destroyer while Trump was in the area. A tarp was also hung over McCain's name, and sailors assigned to the ship who wear hats bearing its name were given the day off. A spokesperson for the Pentagon said Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan didn't know about the White House's request. Trump alos said he was unaware of any effort to move the warship or cover McCain's name.

* **The U.S. has slipped into third place when it comes to the most competitive economies.** While the U.S. is still on top when it comes to economic performance, the boost in confidence from Trump's tax cuts has faded while higher fuel prices and weaker high-tech exports have reduced competitiveness.

* **The bond market is giving ominous warnings about the global economy**. Global bond prices have soared, driving interest rates down sharply. Ten-year Treasury bonds are only yielding 2.26% as of Wednesday, down nearly a full point since Nov. 2018. The outlook for inflation in the years ahead is falling as well, along with the prices of oil and other commodities.
