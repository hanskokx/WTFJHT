1. **Trump threatened to adjourn both chambers of Congress if the Senate doesn't confirm his nominees for various openings across his administration.** Trump warned that Congress should "either fulfill its duty and vote on my nominees or it should formally adjourn so I can make recess appointments." Lawmakers aren't expected to return to Capitol Hill until May 4, but the House and Senate have both been conducting pro forma sessions while they're out. Trump called the practice of "leaving town while conducting phony pro forma sessions" a "scam" and a "dereliction of duty." U.S. presidents have the power under Article II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution to convene either or both chambers of Congress "on extraordinary occasions" or adjourn them "to such time as he shall think proper." No president has ever exercised that authority. There are, however, procedural rules in the Senate that would require consent from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in order to allow Trump to go through with the adjournment.

3. **The White House installed former Trump campaign operative Michael Caputo in the top communications position at the Department of Health and Human Services.** The move is seen as an attempt by Trump to assert more control over HHS Secretary Alex Azar, whom the White House believes is behind a series of recent reports that have been critical of Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Caputo is a long-time friend of Roger Stone and a Trump loyalist who recently published a book called, "The Ukraine Hoax," which claimed there was a conspiracy driving Trump's impeachment.
