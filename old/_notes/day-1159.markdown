1. **The Senate failed to pass a massive coronavirus stimulus bill on Sunday**. Republicans weren't able to get the 60 votes needed to pass the more than $1 trillion aid package. Democrats said they voted against the bill because they were dissatisfied with the worker protections and the lax rules on corporate bailouts in it. A new vote has been scheduled for Monday at noon ET.  Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi said the House plans to draft its own coronavirus stimulus bill and "hopefully it will be compatible with what they discuss on the Senate side." She added: "I don't know about Monday, but we're still talking."

2. **The Justice Department asked Congress to allow chief judges to detain people indefinitely without trial during emergencies.** In one request, the DOJ asked Congress to give the attorney general and top judges broad powers that would allow them to pause court proceedings during emergencies or "whenever the district court is fully or partially closed by virtue of any natural disaster, civil disobedience, or other emergency situation." These new powers would apply to "any statutes or rules of procedure otherwise affecting pre-arrest, post-arrest, pre-trial, trial, and post-trial procedures in criminal and juvenile proceedings and all civil process and proceedings." The DOJ's requests are unlikely to make it through a Democratic-led House. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/doj-coronavirus-emergency-powers-140023))

3. **The Trump administration eliminated a key U.S. public health position in China a few months before the coronavirus pandemic began.** The position, officially known as resident adviser to the U.S. Field Epidemiology Training Program in China, was funded by the CDC and was focused on helping to detect disease outbreaks in China. No other foreign disease experts were embedded to lead the program after Dr. Linda Quick had to leave her post in July amid the U.S. trade dispute with China. The post was officially discontinued as of September 2019. The CDC first learned of a "cluster of 27 cases of pneumonia" of unexplained origin in Wuhan, China on Dec. 31.

4. **Sen. Rand Paul tested positive for COVID-19**, making him the first U.S. senator to contract the virus. He does not have any symptoms and said was not aware of any instance where he had direct contact with an infected person. Earlier this month, Paul was the only senator to vote against a bipartisan deal that would have provided $8 billion in emergency coronavirus funding.

5. **Rep. Ben McAdams has been hospitalized for "severe shortness of breath" after testing positive for COVID-19 last week.** McAdams symptoms started getting worse on Friday, so he called the medical hotline for the virus and was told to go to the hospital and check in with the isolation unit. "I was admitted and have been receiving oxygen as I struggled to maintain my blood oxygen at appropriate levels," McAdams said in a statement. "I am now off oxygen and feeling relatively better and expect to be released as soon as the doctor determines it is appropriate."
