1. **Former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates has added a prominent white-collar attorney to his legal team.** The move to hire Tom Green signals that Gates' approach to his not-guilty plea could be changing behind the scenes. Gates pleaded not guilty in October to eight charges of money laundering and failing to register foreign lobbying and other businesses.
