3. **Trump: "If it was up to me, I’d shut down government over border security." Also Trump, a day earlier: "I don’t see even myself or anybody else closing down the country right now."** Trump has gone back and forth about the possibility of a government shutdown at the end of the month. Recently, he said he'd prefer to wait until after the midterms to shut down the government in order to avoid hurting Republican candidates' chances of winning. "We need Republicans elected in the midterms," Trump said. "We are getting the wall done. But I've had so many people, good people, great people, \[say\] they would rather not do \[it\] before \[the midterms\], they'd rather do it right after the election."

4. **Elizabeth Warren called on members of the Trump administration to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office if they don't think he is capable of doing his job as president.** "If senior administration officials think the President of the United States is not able to do his job," Warren said, "then they should invoke the 25th Amendment." She continued: "The Constitution provides for a procedure whenever the Vice President and senior officials think the President can't do his job. It does not provide that senior officials go around the President — take documents off his desk, write anonymous op-eds ... Everyone of these officials have sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United States. It's time for them to do their job."

5. **Trump told supporters in Montana that it would be their fault if he gets impeached.** During a rally, Trump said that if he is impeached, "it's your fault, 'cause you didn't go out to vote." Trump warned that he would be "the only President in history they'll say: 'What a job he's done! By the way, we're impeaching him.'" He added: "You didn't go out to vote — that's the only way it could happen." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/06/politics/trump-impeach-your-fault/index.html))
