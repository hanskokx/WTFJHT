1. **The Trump administration wants to deport certain protected Vietnamese immigrants who fled to the United States to escape the Vietnam War.** The latest move dictates that Vietnamese immigrants who arrived before the U.S. established formal diplomatic relations with Vietnam will be subject to standard immigration law and lose their special protected status.

2. **Republican Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma bought tens of thousands of dollars in stock in a top defense contractor just days before he began pushing for an unprecedented $750 billion defense spending bill.** When asked about his purchases, Inhofe had his financial adviser cancel the transactions, dump the stock, and avoid defense and aerospace purchases in the future.

3. **Trump canceled the annual White House holiday party for members of the press**, ending the decades-long tradition as his contentious relationship with the media continues to escalate.

4. **The Senate voted to overturn a Trump administration policy that limits the required disclosure of donors for political nonprofits.** The 50-49 vote is seen as a rare rebuke to the White House by the Senate. Republican Sen. Susan Collins joined every Senate Democrat in voting to pass the measure. The measure was opposed by conservative groups and is not expected to make it to the floor of the Republican-controlled House.
