1. **Trump says he won't participate in the second presidential debate on Oct. 13 because it will be virtual instead of in-person.** "I'm not going to waste my time on a virtual debate. It’s not what debating is all about," Trump said. "It's ridiculous." The Commission on Presidential Debates made the announcement early this morning that the second debate would be virtual. Biden's campaign immediately agreed to the new format, but Trump's campaign manager said Trump will "pass on this sad excuse to bail out Joe Biden and do a rally instead." Candidates are not required by law to participate in presidential debates.

2. **Trump required medical personnel at Walter Reed medical center to sign nondisclosure agreements before they could be involved in his treatment.** At least two Walter Reed doctors who refused to sign nondisclosure agreements during Trump's visit in Nov. 2019 were not permitted to be involved in Trump’s care. Trump required signed NDAs from both physicians and nonmedical staff, most of whom are active-duty military service members. The reason for Trump's visit last year is still unknown. Anyone providing medical services to the president — or any other American — is automatically prohibited by federal law from disclosing a patient's health information without consent, which raises questions about why Trump would insist on additional legal measures like an NDA.
