1. **Putin convened a meeting of Russian oligarchs after Trump was elected and encouraged them to make contact with the Trump transition team and establish backchannel communications.** U.S. sanctions against Russia was one of the main issues at hand for Putin and his gathering of oligarchs. The Mueller report didn't establish a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, but it does reveal how important it was to Putin to set up a line of communication, and how receptive members of the Trump's inner circle were to Putin's overtures.

2. **Sarah Huckabee Sanders told Mueller's investigators that she lied to the American public when she said that "countless" FBI agents told her they were thankful that Trump fired James Comey.** Sanders made similar claims on multiple occasions, but she told Mueller's office that she simply made "a slip of the tongue," that the claim was made "in the heat of the moment," and that it "was not founded on anything." When confronted about it on ABC's Good Morning America, Sanders tried to avoid admitting that she lied and ended up doubling-down instead, adding, "I’m sorry that I wasn’t a robot like the Democrat Party."

3. **Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters the Mueller report contains "no evidence substantiated by any facts" that Russia interfered in the 2016 election** and that Moscow rejects any such accusations.
