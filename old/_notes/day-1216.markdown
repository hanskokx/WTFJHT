1. **Trump threatened to permanently withdraw funding from the World Health Organization and cancel U.S. membership**. Trump sent a letter to the director-general of the WHO complaining about the "repeated missteps by you and your organization" and warning that the would permanently end all U.S. financial contributions to the organization if it doesn't "commit to major substantive improvements in the next 30 days." Leaders in Europe and Asia stressed the importance of the WHO's work, called on the U.S. to "stop the blame game," and said this is "not the time for finger pointing" during a global pandemic.

2. **Sen. Bob Menendez will introduce a bill that would limit Trump's ability to fire inspectors general within his administration**. The legislation is a response to Trump's recent firing of State Department inspector general Steve Linick, the fourth IG that Trump has fired in recent months. Menendez says his bill would "prevent a President from carrying out an unjustified—or worse, politically motivated—removal" by giving Congress a "mechanism" to review attempts by a president to remove inspectors general. The bill would only allow a president to remove an IG "for cause," including for misusing funds, abusing their power, or breaking the law.
