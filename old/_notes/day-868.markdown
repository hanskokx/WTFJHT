1. **Trump threatened to impose tariffs on "at least" another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods**, but said he thinks China and Mexico both want to make deals. "Our talks with China, a lot of interesting things are happening," Trump told reporters. "We’ll see what happens... I could go up another at least $300 billion and I’ll do that at the right time." No face-to-face meetings between Trump and Chinese officials have been held since May 10, when Trump announced a 25% increase in tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods.

2. **Trump declared that "not nearly enough" progress has been made in his negotiations with Mexico to end the surge of Central American migrants crossing the border, bringing the U.S. closer to imposing tariffs on all Mexican goods.** Trump warned that "if no agreement is reached, Tariffs at the 5% level will begin on Monday, with monthly increases as per schedule." Trump said talks with Mexico will resume today, but there are no signs that Trump will be satisfied with anything less than direct evidence that Mexico has completely stopped the flow of migration through its country.

3. **Nancy Pelosi told senior Democrats she'd like to see Trump "in prison"** during a meeting with Rep. Jerry Nadler over whether to launch impeachment proceedings against Trump. Nadler pressed Pelosi to begin the proceedings, but Pelosi refused and reiterated that she is not currently open to the idea of impeaching Trump. "I don’t want to see him impeached," Pelosi said, "I want to see him in prison." Pelosi said she prefers voters to remove Trump via the ballot box and then have him prosecuted for his crimes.
