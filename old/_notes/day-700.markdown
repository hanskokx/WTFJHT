1. **Robert Mueller wants the House Intelligence Committee to turn over an official transcript of Roger Stone's testimony, a move which suggests he could be close to charging Stone with a crime.** It's the first time Mueller has formally asked the committee to hand over material it gathered related to the Russia investigation. Stone's relationship with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and whether he played a role in the release of stolen DNC emails has been a focus of the special counsel's investigation for months.

2. **North Korea said it won't give up its nuclear weapons program until it gets concrete security assurances from the United States.** Pyongyang demanded that the U.S. remove what it called a nuclear threat against North Korea before any denuclearization program could take place.
