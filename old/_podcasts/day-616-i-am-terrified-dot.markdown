1/ Christine Blasey Ford testified that she is "100%" certain that Brett Kavanaugh was her attacker, believing he "was going to rape me" and "was going to accidentally kill me."

2/ Kavanaugh called the confirmation process "a national disgrace" and that the sexual assault allegations against him are part of "a calculated and orchestrated political hit" in a fiery opening statement to the committee.

3/ Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee interviewed two men who claim they were the ones who assaulted Ford – not Brett Kavanaugh.

4/ Sen. Susan Collins questioned why the Senate Judiciary Committee has not subpoenaed Mark Judge, a close friend of Kavanaugh's and an alleged witness to the incidents described by Ford and Julia Swetnick.

5/ An anonymous fourth accuser alleged that Brett Kavanaugh physically assaulted a woman in the D.C. area in 1998 while he was drunk.

6/ Trump called the accusations against Kavanaugh "all false," but that he could "always be convinced" and "could be persuaded" otherwise" after watching Ford's testimony because "it's possible they will be convincing."

7/ Three Republican governors called for the Senate to delay the Kavanaugh vote and take its time to examine the sexual assault allegations against him.
