1/ Trump approved the release of the Nunes memo after first attacking both the FBI and the Justice Department in an early-morning tweet.

**TL;DR: THE MEMO.**

* The memo didn't provide the evidence to support the claim that the FBI abused its surveillance power under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act during the 2016 campaign leading to "a troubling breakdown of legal processes established to protect the American people from abuses related to the FISA process."

* The memo also doesn't provide all the evidence the FBI and Justice Department used to obtain the initial warrant to surveil Carter Page, the former Trump campaign adviser.

* The memo confirms that actions taken by George Papadopoulos, the former Trump foreign policy adviser, were a factor in the opening of the investigation. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty last year to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians.

2/ Yesterday, Paul Ryan said the memo is not "an indictment of the FBI, of the Department of Justice" and that he supports the release of the Democrats' memo, which counters the GOP memo.

3/ Trump refused to say if he will fire Rod Rosenstein, who has been overseeing Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation.

4/ Two attorneys representing clients caught up in Robert Mueller's probe believe Mueller could indict Trump for obstruction of justice.

5/ The Trump administration called for the development of two new, "lower-yield" types of nuclear weapons.

6/ The White House wants to see more options for a military strike against North Korea.

**NOTABLES.**

* Seven of the top nine jobs at the State Department are empty.

* K.T. McFarland asked to withdraw her stalled nomination to be the U.S. ambassador to Singapore.

* CIA Director Mike Pompeo met with the head of Russia's foreign intelligence agency.
