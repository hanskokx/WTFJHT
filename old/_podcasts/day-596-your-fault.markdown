✏️ **NOTABLES.**

* George Papadopoulos was sentenced to 14 days in jail, having pled guilty in October 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians.

* Papadopoulos "can't guarantee" that he didn't tell anyone on the Trump campaign that Russia had damaging emails about Hillary Clinton. "I might have," Papadopoulos said, "but I have no recollection of doing so."

* A former Roger Stone associate and longtime Trump ally appeared before Mueller's federal grand jury. Randy Credico is one of at least 10 people associated with Stone who have been contacted by the special counsel.

* Trump "most likely" won't "shut down government over border security" after all.
