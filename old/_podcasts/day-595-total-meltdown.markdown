1/ Brett Kavanaugh challenged whether Roe v. Wade was "settled law of the land" in a leaked 2003 email he wrote while serving in the George W. Bush White House.

2/ Senator Cory Booker released 12 pages of confidential Kavanaugh emails on racial profiling, affirmative action, and other racial issues.

3/ Kavanaugh refused to answer a yes or no question about whether he had discussed Robert Mueller's investigation with one of Trump's attorneys.

4/ The White House is in a state of "total meltdown" with Trump "absolutely livid" and reacting to the anonymous op-ed with "volcanic" anger.

✏️ **NOTABLES.**

* The Trump administration rejected an intelligence report last year showing refugees are not a significant security threat to the U.S.

* The Trump administration plans to ignore a court ruling in order to detain immigrant children with their parents indefinitely.

* A government photographer edited photos of Trump inauguration to make the crowd look bigger than it was after Trump intervened.

**NOTE:** Look out for a full roundup of the Kavanaugh hearings later this week once we have a better perspective on what actually happened.
