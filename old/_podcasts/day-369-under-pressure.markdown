Last year you supported WTF Just Happened Today. Not only does that make you a remarkable human, but it makes you part of the 1% of people who made this project possible.

Because of you, I was able to chronicle the Trump administration's daily shock and awe. We survived alternative facts, the travel ban, rocket man, and covfefe, but nevertheless, we persisted. What will we face in 2018?

So, here's the deal: \
I started WTFJHT as a personal project so I could stay sane. Now, this is my full-time job and we're a community of 200k\+ strong. Wild. 

For the cost of one cup of coffee per month, you can help ensure the continued production of WTF Just Happened Today.

So if WTFJHT is something that you rely on, please consider supporting it.
