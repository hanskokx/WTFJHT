1/ The NRA blamed the Florida school shooting on a "failure of school security" and a "failure of family."

2/ National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster could leave the White House after months of personal tension between him and Trump.

3/ A Trump-appointed federal judge who donated to the Trump campaign and worked on his presidential transition team is refusing to recuse himself from overseeing a legal battle involving Fusion GPS.

4/ Melania Trump's parents may have relied on "chain migration" â€“ the same process that Trump has publicly called on Congress to end. 

5/ In 2016, Trump tweeted that he didn't want "guns in classrooms." Yesterday, he made a "concealed carry" proposal to arm teachers. Today, Trump tweeted that he never said he wanted to "give teachers guns."

6/ Trump's listening session talking points had to remind him to say "I hear you" and to ask "What would you most want me to know about your experience?"

7/ Marco Rubio and the NRA were repeatedly heckled after they refused to back a full ban on military-style assault weapons while discussing gun violence with the high school students who survived the shooting in Parkland, Florida.

**NOTABLES.**

* A Republican congresswoman claimed that "so many" people who commit mass murders "end up being Democrats."  

* A man threw an explosive device over the wall of the U.S. Embassy in Montenegro, but ended up killing himself with the blast. The blast didn't injure anyone else or cause any major property damage.

* Trump Jr. "liked" conspiracy theories on Twitter about last week's school shooting in Florida, including one that called a survivor an agent of "the deep state media."

* Trump is considering pulling Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from California as punishment for what he claimed was a "lousy management job" in patrolling illegal immigration.
