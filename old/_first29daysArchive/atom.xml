   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump weighs mobilizing National Guard for immigration roundups&lt;/strong&gt;. A draft memo proposes to mobilize 100,000 National Guard troops to round up unauthorized immigrants, including millions living nowhere near the Mexico border. The 11-page document calls for the unprecedented militarization of immigration enforcement as far north as Portland, Oregon, and as far east as New Orleans, Louisiana. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/5508111d59554a33be8001bdac4ef830&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Migrants choose arrest in Canada over staying in the U.S.&lt;/strong&gt; People who work with immigrants in Canada say these border-jumpers would rather be arrested in Canada than live in fear of how U.S. officials might handle their cases. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2017/02/17/515662976/migrants-choose-arrest-in-canada-over-staying-in-the-u-s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;strong&gt;Senate on track to confirm Scott Pruitt as EPA administrator&lt;/strong&gt; despite calls from Democrats to delay until he turns over thousands of requested emails from his time as attorney general as part of a public records lawsuit. Democrats boycotted a committee vote on Pruitt’s nomination last month in an effort to delay his confirmation. Republican leaders have shown no signs they intend to wait for the documents to be released before voting to confirm him. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/senate-track-confirm-scott-pruitt-epa-administrator-45555994&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Senate confirms climate-change skeptic Scott Pruitt to lead EPA, an agency he sued as Oklahoma attorney general&lt;/strong&gt;. Pruitt’s confirmation marked a serious defeat for environmental advocacy groups. Pruitt has sued the EPA more than a dozen times during the Obama administration, challenging the agency’s authority to regulate toxic mercury pollution, smog, carbon emissions from power plants and the quality of wetlands and other waters. In Oklahoma, he dismantled a specialized environmental protection unit that had existed under his Democratic predecessor and established a “federalism unit” to combat what he called “unwarranted regulation and systematic overreach” by Washington. Pruitt cleared the Senate by a vote of 52-46. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/02/17/scott-pruitt-long-time-adversary-of-epa-confirmed-to-lead-the-agency/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump – under fire – returns to his scorched-earth politics that served him during the campaign&lt;/strong&gt;. He’ll continue his campaign-style reboot with a rally in Florida, reuniting with the devoted supporters who view Trump as a political crusader dedicated to the obliteration of Washington’s elites. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/17/politics/donald-trump-politics-campaign/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;More Democrats call on Sessions to withdraw from Russia probe&lt;/strong&gt;. A letter sent to Sessions by 55 lawmakers asks him to withdraw based on his ties to Trump’s campaign and key figures who have been alleged to have ties to Russia. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/02/17/more-democrats-call-on-sessions-to-withdraw-from-russia-probe/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;House G.O.P. leaders outline their plan to replace Obamacare&lt;/strong&gt;. Their plan leans heavily on tax credits to finance individual insurance purchases and sharply reducing federal payments to the 31 states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility. They did not say how the legislation would be paid for, essentially laying out the benefits without the more controversial costs. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/us/politics/affordable-care-act-congress.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6/ &lt;strong&gt;Republican strategist Ana Navarro hits Kushner for complaining about CNN: “Oh, baby boy, I’m so sorry”&lt;/strong&gt;. Kushner complained to an executive of Time Warner, CNN’s parent company, about unfair coverage of the Trump administration on CNN. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/320044-ana-navarro-hits-kushner-for-complaining-about-cnn-oh-baby-boy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Hill&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7/ &lt;strong&gt;Chaffetz seeks charge of ex-Clinton aide in email inquiry&lt;/strong&gt;. The chairman of the House Oversight Committee, who has refused Democratic requests to investigate possible conflicts of interest involving Trump, is seeking criminal charges against a Bryan Pagliano, the former State Department employee who helped set up Hillary Clinton’s private email server. Chaffetz sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions asking him to convene a grand jury or charge Pagliano. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/congress/chaffetz-seeks-charge-of-ex-clinton-aide-in-email-inquiry/2017/02/16/28673692-f4a7-11e6-9fb1-2d8f3fc9c0ed_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8/ &lt;strong&gt;Tillerson aides layoff staff at the State Department&lt;/strong&gt;. While Rex Tillerson is on his first overseas trip as Secretary of State, staffers were told that their services were no longer needed at the Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources and the Counselor offices. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/state-dept-layoffs-under-rex-tillerson-being-carried-out/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump has a four-person short list for his national security adviser after retired Harward turned down the job.&lt;/strong&gt; Trump gave no indication on how soon a decision could be made, but he is expected to move quickly even as questions grow over contacts with Russia by the former security adviser, Michael Flynn. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/16/trumps-pick-to-replace-michael-flynn-as-national-security-adviser-turns-down-offer-people-familiar-with-decision-say-2/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump hires Mike Dubke as White House communications director&lt;/strong&gt;. The Crossroads Media founder will relieve pressure on Sean Spicer, who has been both the press secretary and communications director since Trump took office, which have traditionally been separate positions. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/17/trump-expected-to-tap-mike-dubke-as-his-communications-director/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11/ &lt;strong&gt;Ryan struggles to sell tax reform plan to fellow Republicans&lt;/strong&gt;. Ryan has framed his proposal as a compromise between a tariff, which the president wants, and conservative orthodoxy against border taxes. He has suggested it’s in keeping with Trump’s “America first” mantra, since it would reward American manufacturers that make products here and sell it abroad. But the idea is sharply dividing Republicans — even within the White House. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/paul-ryan-tax-reform-republicans-235117&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump promises new immigration order as DOJ holds off appeals court&lt;/strong&gt;. Trump said his administration will issue “a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people” next week. The Justice Department wrote at length in a 47-page about the “seriously flawed” Ninth Circuit ruling from last week, but nevertheless said: “(r)ather than continuing this litigation, the President intends in the near future to rescind the order and replace it with a new, substantially revised executive order to eliminate what the panel erroneously thought were constitutional concerns.” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/16/politics/donald-trump-travel-ban-executive-order/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump call the news media “the enemy of the American people”&lt;/strong&gt; in his escalating war against journalists. Trump has regularly referred to the media as the “opposition party,” and has blamed news organizations for stymieing his presidential agenda. But the language he deployed typically used by presidents to refer to hostile foreign governments or terrorist organizations. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/business/trump-calls-the-news-media-the-enemy-of-the-people.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The FAKE NEWS media (failing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nytimes&quot;&gt;@nytimes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NBCNews&quot;&gt;@NBCNews&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ABC&quot;&gt;@ABC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CBS&quot;&gt;@CBS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CNN&quot;&gt;@CNN&lt;/a&gt;) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/832708293516632065&quot;&gt;February 17, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump wants you to take this bizarre survey on media bias&lt;/strong&gt;. The “Mainstream Media Accountability Survey,” which was emailed to people who had previously signed up for campaign updates is designed to record his supporters’ anger at news organizations. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimdalrympleii/president-trump-wants-you-to-take-this-bizarre-survey-on-med&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

   <link href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/02/16/Day-28/"/>
   <updated>2017-02-16T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/02/16/Day-28</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump delivered a series of raw and personal attacks on the media in a news conference for the ages&lt;/strong&gt;. It was a return to what worked for him during the course of the 2016 campaign: A circuslike atmosphere in which he used the media — and his supporters’ distrust of the media — as a sort of tackling dummy to re-center the narrative on ground more favorable to him. Trump didn’t just run down the media — although he did a lot of that — but he also mocked various outlets, reviewed shows on cable TV that he likes (and doesn’t), told reporters to sit down and be quiet, and critiqued the quality of the questions he was being asked. There was a rawness to his attacks, a personal invective that seemed well beyond the typically antagonistic relationship that exists between the media and the president they cover. This was not a piece of political strategy. This came right from Trump’s gut. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/16/donald-trump-delivers-a-series-of-raw-and-wild-attacks-on-the-media-in-a-press-conference-for-the-ages/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact-checking Trump’s press conference&lt;/strong&gt;. Here’s the rundown of the event. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/feb/16/fact-checking-donald-trumps-press-conference/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PoltiFact&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The transcript from Trump’s combative, grievance-filled press conference&lt;/strong&gt;, along with analysis and annotations. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/16/donald-trumps-grievance-filled-press-conference-annotated/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The most memorable lines from Trump’s news conference&lt;/strong&gt;. His back-and-forth with reporters touched on everything from his critique of the media, his Electoral College margin of victory, the workings of his administration, former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s resignation and more. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/16/politics/most-memorable-lines-donald-trump/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 8 craziest moments of Trump’s impromptu press conference&lt;/strong&gt;. In short, it was a doozy. Here’s the 8 most jaw-dropping moments. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/craziest-moments-trump-press-conference-leaks-russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Talking Points Memo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump laments, “I inherited a mess,” as he names new labor pick&lt;/strong&gt;. Trump’s first choice for labor secretary is R. Alexander Acosta, a Florida law school dean and former assistant attorney general for civil rights. Acosta is the first Hispanic to be tapped for Trump’s cabinet. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/us/politics/alexander-acosta-labor-secretary-trump.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;Spies keep sensitive intelligence from Trump, underscoring deep mistrust&lt;/strong&gt;. U.S. intelligence officials have withheld sensitive intelligence from Trump because they are concerned it could be leaked or compromised. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/spies-keep-intelligence-from-donald-trump-1487209351&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Office of Director of National Intelligence: We don’t withhold intel from Trump&lt;/strong&gt;. “Any suggestion that the U.S. Intelligence Community is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true,” an ODNI statement said. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/office-director-national-intelligence-trump-intel-wsj-235080&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz asks the Department of Justice to investigate the leaks surrounding Michael Flynn&lt;/strong&gt;. The steady stream of “potentially classified” intelligence community leaks that have thrown the Trump administration into turmoil. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/chaffetz-leaks-michael-flynn-235079&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In FBI interview last month Flynn denied discussing sanctions with Russian ambassador&lt;/strong&gt;. The Jan. 24 interview potentially puts Flynn in legal jeopardy, as lying to the FBI is a felony, but any decision to prosecute would ultimately lie with the Justice Department. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/flynn-in-fbi-interview-denied-discussing-sanctions-with-russian-ambassador/2017/02/16/e3e1e16a-f3d5-11e6-8d72-263470bf0401_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harward says no to national security adviser role&lt;/strong&gt;. A friend of Harward’s said he was reluctant to take the job because the White House seems so chaotic. Harward called the offer a “s*** sandwich,” the friend said. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/16/politics/harward-says-no-to-national-security-adviser-role/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. allies intercepted a series of communications between Trump advisers and Russian officials before the inauguration&lt;/strong&gt;. Sources said the interceptions include at least one contact between former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and a Russian official based in the U.S. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsweek.com/allies-intercept-russia-trump-adviser-communications-557283&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;White House plans to have a Trump ally review intelligence agencies&lt;/strong&gt;. Trump’s plan to assign a New York billionaire to lead a broad review of American intelligence agencies has members of the intelligence community fearing it could curtail their independence and reduce the flow of information that contradicts the president’s worldview. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/us/politics/trump-intelligence-agencies-stephen-feinberg.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump’s professed love for leaks has quickly faded&lt;/strong&gt;. As a candidate, Trump embraced the hackers who had leaked Clinton’s emails to the press, declaring “I love WikiLeaks!” Trump has changed his mind. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/us/politics/leaks-donald-trump.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6/ &lt;strong&gt;The Kremlin ordered state media to cut way back on their fawning coverage of Trump&lt;/strong&gt;, reflecting a growing concern among senior Russian officials that the new U.S. administration will be less friendly than first thought. In January, Trump received more mentions in the media than Putin, relegating the Russian leader to the No. 2 spot for the first time since he returned to the Kremlin in 2012 after four years as premier. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-02-16/kremlin-said-to-tell-media-to-cut-back-on-fawning-trump-coverage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOP senators unnerved by Trump-Russia relationship&lt;/strong&gt;. While Republicans aren’t yet willing to endorse a special investigative committee, GOP senators have indicated that could change. Democrats are treading carefully in hopes that Republicans make their concerns public and support a thorough and public investigation of contacts between Trump and Russia. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/319800-gop-senators-unnerved-by-trump-russia-relationship&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Hill&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7/ &lt;strong&gt;Businesses across U.S. close, students skip school on “Day Without Immigrants”&lt;/strong&gt; to underscore how much migrants form the lifeblood of the country’s economy and social structure. Immigrants in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Austin, Texas, and other major U.S. cities plan to stay home from work and school as part of a strike. Demonstrators also planned a march to the White House. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/02/16/a-day-without-immigrants-strike/97965460/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8/ &lt;strong&gt;ICE detains woman seeking domestic abuse protection at Texas courthouse&lt;/strong&gt;. A hearing in El Paso County in Texas went from ordinary to “unprecedented” last week when half a dozen Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents showed up at a courthouse where an undocumented woman was seeking a protective order against the boyfriend she accused of abusing her. She left under arrest. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/16/this-is-really-unprecedented-ice-detains-woman-seeking-domestic-abuse-protection-at-texas-courthouse/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The White House has found ways to end protection for “Dreamers” while shielding Trump from blowback&lt;/strong&gt;. Trump’s aides have examined at least two options for repealing DACA that would not directly involve Trump: a lawsuit brought by states, and new legal guidance that details who is a priority for deportation. Trump has repeatedly promised to end the program on “day one” of his presidency and called the protections “unconstitutional executive amnesty.” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-daca-20170216-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9/ &lt;strong&gt;Leaked emails show Justice Clarence Thomas’s wife pushing travel ban&lt;/strong&gt;. In an email sent to a conservative listserv, Ginni Thomas asked for advice on how to organize in favor of Trump’s travel ban. But by doing so, she may have inadvertently made it harder for the executive order to survive the Supreme Court. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/02/16/leaked-emails-show-justice-clarence-thomas-s-wife-pushing-travel-ban.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump signs law rolling back disclosure rule for energy and mining companies&lt;/strong&gt;. The bill cancels out a Securities and Exchange Commission regulation that would have required oil and gas and mining companies to disclose in detail the payments they make to foreign governments in a bid to boost transparency in resource-rich countries. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-signs-law-rolling-back-disclosure-rule-for-energy-and-mining-companies/2017/02/14/ccd93e90-f2cd-11e6-b9c9-e83fce42fb61_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11/ &lt;strong&gt;The Endangered Species Act may be heading for the threatened list&lt;/strong&gt;. A Senate hearing to “modernize the Endangered Species Act” unfolded just as supporters of the law had feared, with round after round of criticism from Republican lawmakers who said the federal effort to keep species from going extinct encroaches on states’ rights, is unfair to landowners and stymies efforts by mining companies to extract resources and create jobs. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/02/15/the-endangered-species-act-may-be-heading-for-the-threatened-list-this-hearing-confirmed-it/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12/ &lt;strong&gt;The EPA posted a mirror of its site before Trump can cut the real one&lt;/strong&gt;. The mirror is an archive of the site the way it appeared the day before Trump took office. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/the-epa-posted-a-mirror-of-its-website-before-trump-can-gut-the-real-one-vgtrn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vice&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E.P.A. workers try to block Trump’s contentious nominee to run the agency in show of defiance&lt;/strong&gt;. Employees of the E.P.A. have been calling their senators, urging them to vote against the confirmation of Scott Pruitt. Many of the scientists, environmental lawyers and policy experts who work in E.P.A. offices say the calls are a last resort. Pruitt has made a career out of fighting the agency. Trump has vowed to “get rid of” it.

&lt;p&gt;13/ &lt;strong&gt;More than 200 Republicans in Congress are skipping February town halls with constituents&lt;/strong&gt;.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump campaign aides had repeated contact with Russian intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; during the 2016 campaign according to four current and former American officials. Phone records and intercepted calls show that the communications happened around the same time evidence was discovered that Russia was trying to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee. U.S. intelligence agencies sought to learn whether the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians on the hacking or other efforts to influence the election. They have seen no evidence of such cooperation, so far. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/russia-intelligence-communications-trump.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s bigger than Flynn. New Russia revelations widen Trump’s credibility gap&lt;/strong&gt;. Trump’s long-term fixation on and admiration for Vladimir Putin as well as Flynn’s departure has lent new gravity and intensity to long-simmering questions about Trump and Russia. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2017/02/15/daily-202-it-s-bigger-than-flynn-new-russia-revelations-widen-trump-s-credibility-gap/58a3c5b9e9b69b1406c75cb4/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump aides were in constant touch with senior Russian officials during campaign&lt;/strong&gt;. The communications stood out to investigators due to the frequency and the level of the Trump advisers involved. Investigators have not reached a judgment on the intent of those conversations. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/14/politics/donald-trump-aides-russians-campaign/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Puzder withdraws from consideration as labor secretary&lt;/strong&gt;. The Hardee’s/Carl’s Jr. CEO came under intense fire from Democrats and liberal groups who accused him of mistreating his workers, opposing the minimum wage and supporting automation in the workplace. The attacks on his policy views were compounded by intense scrutiny of his personal life, including allegations that he abused his ex-wife in the 1980s. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/us/politics/andrew-puzder-withdrew-labor-secretary.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;McConnell to White House: Andrew Puzder lacks the votes to win confirmation&lt;/strong&gt;. At least seven Republican senators said they planned to withhold support for Puzder, saying that they wanted to see how the political novice fares at his confirmation hearing. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/now-6-republicans-are-on-the-fence-about-andrew-puzder/2017/02/15/e34cada6-f38b-11e6-8d72-263470bf0401_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;Senators from both parties pledge to deepen probe of Russia and the 2016 election&lt;/strong&gt;. Mitch McConnell said an investigation is “highly likely,” and the top two members of the Senate Intelligence Committee announced that the committee’s ongoing probe must include an examination of any contacts between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/top-senate-republican-blunt-says-congress-should-probe-flynn-situation/2017/02/14/8abbcad4-f2d5-11e6-a9b0-ecee7ce475fc_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Senator Lindsey Graham: Any Trump ally working inappropriately with Russia “needs to pay a price”&lt;/strong&gt;. If the reports are true about communication between Trump’s aides and Russia during the campaign, Graham said Congress needs a joint select committee to examine Trump’s business ties to Russia. Trump called recent news stories reporting that his aides had contact with Russian intelligence officials during the 2016 elections “fake news” Wednesday morning and said the “Russian connection non-sense” was an attempt to “cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton’s losing campaign.” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/lindsey-graham-trump-allies-working-with-russia-235040&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;Jeff Sessions resists pressure to remove himself from his role in investigating Trump’s aides and their relationship with Russia&lt;/strong&gt;. Democrats and outside groups say Sessions lacks the independence to oversee criminal investigations that might lead back to the White House. Sessions and Flynn were both early, influential advisers in Trump’s presidential campaign. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-russia-inquiries.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;Flynn’s departure erupts into a full-blown crisis for the Trump White House&lt;/strong&gt;. The circumstances leading up to Flynn’s departure have quickly become a major crisis for the fledgling administration, forcing the White House on the defensive and precipitating the first significant breach in relations between Trump and an increasingly restive Republican Congress. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/flynn-departure-erupts-into-a-full-blown-crisis-for-the-trump-white-house/2017/02/14/c1f3cb90-f2db-11e6-8d72-263470bf0401_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mike Pence told about Flynn warning two weeks after Trump&lt;/strong&gt;. The White House kept Pence in the dark for weeks about the warning it had gotten about national security adviser Michael Flynn from the Justice Department. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/mike-pence-told-about-flynn-warning-11-days-after-trump-n720836&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump lashed out at the nation’s intelligence agencies again&lt;/strong&gt;, accusing them on Twitter of illegally leaking information to the news media. The flurry on tweets come as new disclosures about his dealings with Russia during and after the presidential campaign surfaced. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/us/politics/trump-condemns-leaks-to-news-media-in-a-twitter-flurry.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6/ &lt;strong&gt;House panel votes against requesting Trump’s tax returns&lt;/strong&gt;. Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday argued that requesting Trump’s tax returns is important to get more information about Trump’s potential conflicts of interest. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/policy/finance/319438-house-panel-votes-against-requesting-trumps-tax-returns&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Hill&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7/ &lt;strong&gt;Republican congressman reveals bill to abolish the EPA&lt;/strong&gt;. The freshman congressman from Florida has finally released a summary of the agency-killing bill. It tops out at just more than 40 words. This news item is 37 words. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/15/freshman-republican-congressman-reveals-bill-to-abolish-the-epa.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump aims to sign executive orders cutting into the EPA’s climate work shortly after his nominee to lead the agency is confirmed by the Senate&lt;/strong&gt;. Trump has vowed to roll back Obama-era EPA actions, including major climate change regulations like the Clean Power Plan and a water jurisdiction rule opposed by many conservatives. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/319667-report-trump-aiming-to-sign-sweeping-epa-executive-orders&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Hill&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the entire bill to terminate the EPA&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/861/text&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Congress.gov&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8/ &lt;strong&gt;A DREAMer was arrested during a raid&lt;/strong&gt; and now a federal magistrate judge has ordered officials to defend the arrest of an undocumented immigrant who has protection from deportation. Attorneys filed a lawsuit accusing federal authorities of unlawfully arresting a Mexican immigrant in Seattle despite him having protection from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/adolfoflores/immigrations-officials-ordered-to-defend-arrest-of-dreamer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump to welcome Netanyahu for talks that could shape the contours of future Middle East policy&lt;/strong&gt;. Palestinians fear the U.S. will abandon its two-state solution for the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Palestine living peacefully alongside Israel has been the bedrock U.S. position for decades. Negotiations broke down in 2014. Under a two-state solution, Israel would end its military occupation of Palestinian areas and allow the Palestinians to form their own self-governing state. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-israel-idUSKBN15U0GB&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump said that the U.S. would no longer insist on a Palestinian state&lt;/strong&gt; as part of a peace accord between Israel and the Palestinians, backing away from a policy that has underpinned America’s role in Middle East peacemaking since the Clinton administration. The comments are a striking departure from two decades of diplomatic orthodoxy. The Palestinians are highly unlikely to accept anything short of a sovereign state. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/world/middleeast/benjamin-netanyahu-israel-trump.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump skirts tough questions again&lt;/strong&gt;. In a joint appearance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump only called on reporters from conservative news outlets, or at least outlets likely to be favorable to him. This is now the third bilateral appearance in which Trump appeared to skirt questions about controversial issues by not taking questions from the traditional stable of the press corps. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/15/media/netanyahu-trump-press-conference-questions/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11/ &lt;strong&gt;Doubts grow that GOP can repeal Obamacare&lt;/strong&gt;. Republicans are sniping over how much of the law to scrap, what to replace it with and when. At this moment, it’s far from a sure thing any plan could get through Congress. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/obamacare-repeal-replace-republicans-235020&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12/ &lt;strong&gt;Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued an ultimatum to NATO allies&lt;/strong&gt;, warning that if they do not boost their defense spending to goals set by the alliance, the United States may alter its relationship with them. It marks an escalation in Washington’s long-running frustration that many NATO countries do not spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product as they have pledged. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/02/15/mattis-trumps-defense-secretary-issues-ultimatum-to-nato-allies-on-defense-spending/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump will not fill out an NCAA tournament bracket&lt;/strong&gt;. Fun sponge. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2017/02/15/trump-will-not-fill-out-an-ncaa-tournament-bracket/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;poll/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump trails generic Democrat in 2020&lt;/strong&gt;. In a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll. roughly a quarter of voters think Trump is the worst president in the last century. 43% percent of voters are ready to vote for a nameless Democrat in 2020. Just over a third say they’ll vote for Trump in 2020. In a hypothetical matchup, he beats Sen. Elizabeth Warren 42% to 36%. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/poll-trump-democrats-elizabeth-warren-235026&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;survey/ &lt;strong&gt;Americans are seriously stressed out about the future of the country&lt;/strong&gt;. No shit. 66% of Americans reported stress about the future of the country, 57% about the current political climate and 49% about the election outcome. The survey was conducted by Harris Poll. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2017/02/15/americans-are-seriously-stressed-out-about-the-future-of-the-country-survey-finds/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 26: Clusterfuck.</title>
   <link href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/02/14/Day-26/"/>
   <updated>2017-02-14T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/02/14/Day-26</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;Russia has secretly deployed a new cruise missile&lt;/strong&gt; despite violation of the arms control treaty that helped seal the end of the Cold War. The move presents a major challenge for President Trump, who has vowed to improve relations with Putin and to pursue future arms accords. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/world/europe/russia-cruise-missile-arms-control-treaty.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump knew Flynn misled officials on Russia calls for “weeks”&lt;/strong&gt; the White House says. The comment contrasts the impression Trump gave aboard Air Force One that he was not familiar with a report that revealed Flynn had not told the truth about the calls. White House counsel Don McGahn told Trump in a January briefing that Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions with Russia. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/14/trump-was-told-weeks-ago-that-flynn-misled-vice-president-about-russia-contacts-white-house-says/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The timeline of Michael Flynn’s resignation looks bad for the Trump White House&lt;/strong&gt;. Was the White House concerned that Flynn had apparently lied to them — or at least done something he shouldn’t have and failed to disclose it? Would it ever have taken corrective action if the situation hadn’t been made public? (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/14/the-timeline-of-michael-flynns-resignation-is-troubling-for-the-trump-white-house/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The F.B.I. interviewed Flynn in the first days of the Trump administration about his conversations with the Russian ambassador&lt;/strong&gt;. If he was not entirely honest with the F.B.I., it could expose Flynn, who resigned his post, to a felony charge. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/fbi-interviewed-mike-flynn.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flynn sets record with only 24 days as national security adviser&lt;/strong&gt;. The average tenure is about 2.6 years. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/14/flynn-sets-record-with-only-24-days-as-nsc-chief-the-average-tenure-is-about-2-6-years/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;A member of the Senate Intelligence Committee calls for an exhaustive investigation into Trump-Russia connections following Flynn’s resignation&lt;/strong&gt;. “The national security adviser of all the people that work with and for the President has to be absolutely trustworthy and truthful and apparently he wasn’t and he paid the price for that…” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/14/politics/kfile-roy-blunt-flynn-investigation/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;McConnell: Flynn investigation “highly likely” in Senate committee&lt;/strong&gt;. The Senate’s second-ranking Republican and other GOP senators have called for an investigation into the episode, building on a string of investigations underway on Russian interference in the US elections. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/14/politics/republicans-want-flynn-investigations/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;House Republicans rejected calls for an independent investigation into Flynn’s communications with Russia&lt;/strong&gt;, laying bare the party’s reticence to challenge Trump in the early weeks of his presidency. The chair of the intelligence committee said he was less concerned with investigating Flynn’s conduct than with the question of who was behind the leaks that quickly spiraled into the former official’s dramatic resignation. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/14/congress-republicans-michael-flynn-investigation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democrats demand that Flynn’s resignation spur broader Russia investigation&lt;/strong&gt;. In a joint statement, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee and the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said, “We in Congress need to know who authorized his actions, permitted them and continued to let him have access to our most sensitive national security information despite knowing these risks. We need to know who else within the White House is a current and ongoing risk to our national security.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/donald-trump-administration-michael-flynn-resignation.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FBI needs to explain why Flynn’s call were recorded&lt;/strong&gt; with the Russian ambassador and later leaked information to the press. Intelligence officials had recorded Flynn’s conversations with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office. Those recordings  appeared to contradict Flynn’s own claims that he had not discussed easing U.S. sanctions on Russia. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/02/14/fbi-needs-to-explain-why-michael-flynn-was-recorded-gop-intelligence-chairman-says/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;Ethics office: Conway committed “clear violation” with Ivanka plug&lt;/strong&gt; and recommends that the White House investigate  Trump’s senior adviser. Conway offered what she described as a “free commercial” for Ivanka Trump’s clothing line after Nordstrom pulled her items from its racks, drawing a Twitter rebuke from Trump. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/ethics-office-conway-committed-clear-violation-with-ivanka-plug-235010&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scarborough rips Conway as an “out of the loop” liar after Flynn resignation&lt;/strong&gt;. Conway’s assertion that Flynn enjoyed “the full confidence of the president” just hours before he offered his resignation is proof that Conway is acting recklessly.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;Michael Flynn resigns as National Security Adviser&lt;/strong&gt; after it was revealed that he had misled  Pence and other top White House officials about his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Flynn served in the job for less than a month. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/politics/donald-trump-national-security-adviser-michael-flynn.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flynn on thin ice but still in at the White House after turbulent few days&lt;/strong&gt;. Despite a turbulent 72 hours caused by the national security adviser’s inability to deny that he spoke about sanctions against Russia with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office, Flynn has no plans to resign and no expectations that he will be fired. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/13/politics/michael-flynn-donald-trump-white-house/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flynn apologizes after admitting he may have discussed sanctions with Russia&lt;/strong&gt;. The apology was directed most notably to Pence, who had emphatically denied to CBS News last month that Flynn had discussed “anything having to do with the United States’ decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia.” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/13/flynn-apologizes-after-admitting-he-may-have-discussed-sanctions-russia/97852248/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Justice Department had warned White House that Flynn could be vulnerable to Russian blackmail&lt;/strong&gt;. Current and former officials said that although they believed that Pence was misled about the contents of Flynn’s communications with the Russian ambassador, they couldn’t rule out that Flynn was acting with the knowledge of others in the transition. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-warned-white-house-that-flynn-could-be-vulnerable-to-russian-blackmail-officials-say/2017/02/13/fc5dab88-f228-11e6-8d72-263470bf0401_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump declines to say whether he has full confidence in Flynn&lt;/strong&gt;, deferring to a statement to come. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2017/02/13/515049707/conway-national-security-adviser-flynn-has-trumps-full-confidence&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump remains silent as Flynn falls under growing pressure&lt;/strong&gt;. Neither Trump nor his advisers have publicly defended Flynn or stated unequivocally that he has the president’s confidence. Privately, some administration officials said that Flynn’s position has weakened and support for him has eroded largely because of a belief that he was disingenuous about Russia and therefore could not be fully trusted going forward. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-flynn-falls-under-growing-pressure-over-russia-contacts-trump-remains-silent/2017/02/12/2b58f31e-f15e-11e6-b9c9-e83fce42fb61_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flynn’s dealings with Russia aside, there are even deeper ties that connect the current administration to the Kremlin&lt;/strong&gt;. Some Pentagon officials say they have “assumed that the Kremlin has ears” inside the White House ever since Trump’s inauguration. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/13/beyond-flynn-other-ties-bind-the-white-house-to-the-kremlin/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;strong&gt;At Mar-a-Lago, Trump tackles crisis diplomacy at close range&lt;/strong&gt;. Wealthy members looked on from their tables, and with a keyboard player crooning in the background, Trump and Abe’s evening meal quickly morphed into a strategy session, the decision-making on full view to fellow diners. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/12/politics/trump-shinzo-abe-mar-a-lago-north-korea/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump turns Mar-a-Lago Club terrace into open-air situation room&lt;/strong&gt;. Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe could have discussed classified documents within earshot of waiters and club patrons. Those cellphones-turned-flashlights might also have been a problem: If one of them had been hacked by a foreign power, the phone’s camera could have provided a view of what the documents said. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-turns-mar-a-lago-club-terrace-into-open-air-situation-room/2017/02/13/c5525096-f20d-11e6-a9b0-ecee7ce475fc_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump responds to North Korean missile launch with uncharacteristic restraint&lt;/strong&gt;. Trump read a statement of just 23 words that pledged American support for Tokyo without even mentioning North Korea. The muted comment stood in sharp contrast to his response after Iran tested a ballistic missile, when he directed his national security adviser to publicly warn Tehran that he was “officially putting Iran on notice” and followed up with sanctions. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/12/us/politics/donald-trump-north-korea-missile.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;Steven Mnuchin wins slim vote for Treasury secretary&lt;/strong&gt;. The Senate’s 53-47 vote split along party lines and was one of the slimmest ever for a Treasury pick. By March 17, Mnuchin needs to persuade Congress to increase the nation’s debt limit. If he can’t, he would have to start using a series of so-called extraordinary measures to extend the deadline for several weeks to avoid a U.S. default on its debt. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-mnuchin-treasury-senate-20170213-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;Trudeau and Trump try to bridge some gaps while avoiding others&lt;/strong&gt;. Trump has called for a halt to the admission of refugees, while Trudeau has held out Canada as a haven for refugees, particularly people who have fled the war in Syria. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/world/canada/justin-trudeau-donald-trump.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump reviews top White House staff after tumultuous start&lt;/strong&gt;. Trump, frustrated over his administration’s rocky start, is complaining to friends and allies about some of his most senior aides — leading to questions about whether he is mulling an early staff shakeup. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trump-white-house-staff-234949&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G.O.P. lawmakers like what they see in Trump – they just have to squint.&lt;/strong&gt; Trump has made clear that he is going to continue promulgating conspiracy theories, flinging personal insults and saying things that are plainly untrue. And the Republican-controlled House and Senate seem to have made a collective decision: They will accommodate — not confront — his conduct as long as he signs their long-stalled conservative proposals on taxes, regulations and health care into law. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/12/us/politics/trump-gop-lawmakers.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6/ &lt;strong&gt;Courts still proceeding with lawsuits — and a new injunction — against Trump’s travel ban&lt;/strong&gt;. While the Justice Department lawyers attempted to confine the court battle to the federal appeals court hearing the challenge out of Washington, two district court judges on Monday sided with challengers to the president’s executive order.

&lt;p&gt;7/ &lt;strong&gt;Federal immigration officials arrested more than 600 people across at least 11 states last week&lt;/strong&gt;, detaining 40 people in the New York City area, law enforcement officials said. It’s unclear whether the actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were part of continuing operations to round up illegal immigrants with criminal convictions or a ramping-up of deportations by the Trump administration. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/12/nyregion/immigration-arrests-sanctuary-city.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8/ &lt;strong&gt;California governor asks Trump for storm disaster declaration&lt;/strong&gt;, as the state grapples with a massive dam spillway glitch in the Sierra foothills. A disaster declaration frees up federal funds to help pay for damage. Presidents usually respond positively to such requests. Trump called California “out of control” last week without explaining exactly what he meant. Trump also threatened to block federal funds if California goes ahead with plans to become a sanctuary state for immigrants. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brown-trump-california-disaster_us_589ea87de4b094a129eb64f0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump undertakes most ambitious regulatory rollback since Reagan&lt;/strong&gt;. The new administration is targeting dozens of Obama-era policies, using both legislative and executive tactics. The fallout is already rippling across the federal ­bureaucracy and throughout the U.S. economy, affecting how dentists dispose of mercury fillings, how schools meet the needs of poor and disabled students, and whether companies reject mineral purchases that fuel one of the world’s bloodiest conflicts. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-undertakes-most-ambitious-regulatory-rollback-since-reagan/2017/02/12/0337b1f0-efb4-11e6-9662-6eedf1627882_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10/ &lt;strong&gt;America’s biggest foreign creditors dump Treasuries in warning to Trump&lt;/strong&gt;. Few overseas investors want to step into the $13.9 trillion U.S. Treasury market right now. Whether it’s the prospect of bigger deficits and more inflation under Trump or higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve, the world’s safest debt market seems less of a sure thing. And then there is Trump’s penchant for saber rattling, which has made staying home that much easier. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-12/america-s-biggest-creditors-dump-treasuries-in-warning-to-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump ran a campaign based on intelligence security. That’s not how he’s governing.&lt;/strong&gt; The president discussed a national security incident in a public room, with phone flashlights lighting the way. Why is this important? Mobile phones have flashlights — and cameras, microphones and Internet connectivity. Phones — especially phones with their flashes turned on for improved visibility — are portable television satellite trucks and, if compromised, can be used to get a great deal of information about what’s happening nearby, unless precautions are taken.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;North Korea challenges Trump by firing a ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan&lt;/strong&gt;. The missile launch came as Trump hosts Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, on an official visit. The missile was a medium- or intermediate-range system and “did not pose a threat to North America.” South Korea condemned the missile launching, saying that it violated a series of United Nations Security Council resolutions that bar North Korea from developing or testing ballistic missile and nuclear weapons technologies. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/11/world/asia/north-korea-missile-test-trump.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump: “America stands behind Japan” after North Korea missile test&lt;/strong&gt;. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trump-america-stands-behind-japan-after-north-korea-missile-test-234937&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Few good options in Trump arsenal to counter defiant North Korea&lt;/strong&gt;. Possible responses include additional sanctions to beefed-up missile defense. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-usa-analysis-idUSKBN15R0Z5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;strong&gt;Senior White House policy adviser Stephen Miller doubled down on President Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud&lt;/strong&gt;, including the president’s reported claim that thousands of voters were bused into New Hampshire to illegally cast ballots in the presidential election. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-adviser-doubles-claims-voter-fraud-thousands-voters/story?id=45436933&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miller says White House will fight for travel ban&lt;/strong&gt;. The White House is pursuing several options to reinstate Trump’s travel ban, fighting back against “judicial usurpation of power.” He said legal options to restore the ban — “the very apex of presidential authority” — include an emergency hearing with the full 9th Circuit. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/02/12/stephen-miller-says-white-house-will-fight-for-travel-ban-advances-false-voter-fraud-claims/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miller is a “true believer” behind core Trump policies&lt;/strong&gt;. Miller has been at the epicenter of some of the administration’s most provocative moves, from pushing hard for the construction of a wall along the border with Mexico to threatening decades-long trade deals at the heart of Republican economic orthodoxy, to rolling out Trump’s travel ban.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie criticized Trump’s national security adviser Michael Flynn&lt;/strong&gt;, saying he needs to clear up questions about whether he discussed sanctions in his pre-inauguration conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States.

&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;The spy revolt against Trump begins&lt;/strong&gt;. Fears that the White House is too friendly to Moscow is causing close allies to curtail some of their espionage relationships with Washington.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;Reports of raids have immigrants bracing for enforcement surge&lt;/strong&gt;. Officials at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, said the immigration roundups did not represent an increased tempo. ICE described it as a routine “targeted enforcement action” in which roughly 160 people were arrested in six counties around Los Angeles. Of those, 150 had criminal histories. The agency has about 100 fugitive teams constantly working to bring in those wanted on a variety of immigration offenses. These teams have been just as active as they were during the Obama administration. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/us/immigration-raids-enforcement.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;strong&gt;The Trump administration is turning on Mike Flynn while the CIA freezes out Flynn’s aide&lt;/strong&gt;. The agency denied a security clearance for a key aide to the National Security Adviser, effectively ending his tenure on the National Security Council and escalating tensions between Flynn and the intelligence community. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/mike-flynn-nsa-aide-trump-234923&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flynn holds call with Pence amid calls for probes of contacts with Russian ambassador&lt;/strong&gt;. Flynn had urged Moscow to show restraint in its response to punitive sanctions being imposed on Russia by the Obama administration, signaling that the Trump administration would revisit the issue when it took office. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/flynn-holds-call-with-pence-amid-calls-for-probes-of-contacts-with-russian-ambassador/2017/02/10/f8fb83a0-efe1-11e6-9973-c5efb7ccfb0d_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Flynn’s debacle&lt;/strong&gt;. Trump’s national security adviser’s potentially false statements about his pre-inauguration contacts with Russian officials are a major scandal.

&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;GOP bill would gut EPA&lt;/strong&gt;. A House Republican is sponsoring legislation to do away with large portions of the Environmental Protection Agency, including environmental justice and greenhouse gas programs. The Wasteful EPA Programs Elimination Act would save $7.5 billion annually and would leave the EPA with a budget of less than $1 billion. Major EPA climate change programs would be eliminated under the measure.

&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump: Refugees are flooding the U.S. and creating a “dangerous” situation&lt;/strong&gt; after the judge blocked his travel ban. The percentage of refugees arriving from the so-called seven banned countries — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — has risen considerably since the directive was suspended. However, the weekly total of refugees arriving from the targeted countries has risen by only about 100. All are stringently vetted. Trump made the post at the start of a day of golf with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan at his resort in Jupiter, Florida.

&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;The Justice Department is taking a step back from efforts to protect transgender people under existing law&lt;/strong&gt;. The department withdrew a request to limit an injunction halting enforcement of existing civil rights laws that provide protections for transgender people. The moves suggests that the federal government’s position on the pending legal questions surrounding transgender people’s rights could be changing soon.

&lt;p&gt;6/ &lt;strong&gt;Hundreds of protests against Planned Parenthood and counterprotests in support of the nonprofit are taking place across the country today&lt;/strong&gt;. A national coalition opposed to abortion rights seeks to end any public funding for Planned Parenthood. Supporters of Planned Parenthood are rallying today to show solidarity for the nonprofit organization, which provides a variety of health services including cancer screenings, HIV testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections as well as family planning, birth control and abortion.

&lt;p&gt;7/ &lt;strong&gt;Al Franken to Maher: GOP senators privately express “great concern” about Trump’s temperament&lt;/strong&gt;. Franken isn’t the first Democrat to say Republicans senators are privately fretting. Sen. Sherrod Brown said his GOP colleagues privately worry about Trump’s “incompetence” and “ethics.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/11/al-franken-tells-maher-gop-senators-privately-express-great-concern-about-trumps-temperament/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump to Dems: “Pocahontas is now the face of your party”&lt;/strong&gt; – his insult of choice for Elizabeth Warren. Trump said the only reason Warren claimed Native American heritage was “because she has high cheekbones.” Trump was referencing questions over Warren’s ancestry from her 2012 Senate race.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump: Border wall price “will come WAY DOWN” when I negotiate&lt;/strong&gt;. Trump responded to reports that the cost of his proposed border wall is much higher than expected, insisting that it will be much cheaper after he gets involved in negotiations.

&lt;p&gt;9/ &lt;strong&gt;“We’re going to see more” sanctuary cities cave in face of Trump’s funding threats&lt;/strong&gt;. Several towns, cities and counties around the nation are caving to President Trump’s threat to pull funding, and abandoning their “sanctuary” pledges to shield illegal immigrants from federal authorities. The changes come on the heels of Trump’s executive order giving the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security the power to cut federal funding to communities that are deemed sanctuaries for illegal immigrants. Trump also has authorized the DHS to publish a weekly list of sanctuary communities. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/10/were-going-to-see-more-sanctuary-cities-cave-in-face-trumps-funding-threats.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“A sense of dread” for civil servants shaken by the Trump transition&lt;/strong&gt;. Across the vast federal bureaucracy anxiety, frustration, fear and resistance has spread among many of the two million nonpolitical civil servants who say they work for the public, not a particular president.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10/ &lt;strong&gt;Utah’s Rep. Jason Chaffetz faces the “Resistance” in his home state&lt;/strong&gt;. The backlash was not just about policy—it was fueled by anger that the congressman was shirking his duty as chairman of the House Oversight Committee by refusing to investigate Trump. In their view, his was not just a failure of government, but of character. Despite Utah’s status as one of the most conservative states in the country, Trump has never been very popular there. He carried the state’s electoral votes last year with just 45 percent of the vote. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/inside-the-utah-resistance/516303/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11/ &lt;strong&gt;State G.O.P. leaders move swiftly as party bickers in Congress&lt;/strong&gt;. While Republicans in Washington appear flummoxed by the complexities of one-party rule, rising party leaders in the states seem far more at ease and assertive. Republicans have top-to-bottom control in 25 states now, holding both the governorship and the entire legislature, and Republican lawmakers are acting with lightning speed to enact longstanding conservative priorities.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;White House now says it may take travel ban to the Supreme Court&lt;/strong&gt;. Minutes after one White House official said Trump would not appeal the 9th Circuit ruling upholding a temporary stay of the travel ban, Reince Priebus said the White House is now “reviewing all of our options in the court system,” including possibly going to the Supreme Court. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/white-house-considers-rewriting-trumps-immigration-order/2017/02/10/ddcf5a6a-efb5-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Earlier: &lt;strong&gt;When asked if Trump was considering signing a new executive order on immigration: “Nothing’s off the table.”&lt;/strong&gt; Trump also has the option of going back to the drawing board and coming up with a new way to impose “extreme vetting” restrictions he says are necessary. But it seems certain he will not take the route since to do so would involve not only admitting the bitter taste of a high stakes legal defeat but repudiating the combative win-at-all-costs attitude that animates his character. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/10/politics/donald-trump-travel-ban-politics/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;strong&gt;US investigators corroborate some aspects of the Russia dossier&lt;/strong&gt; compiled by a former British intelligence agent. None of the newly learned information relates to the salacious allegations in the dossier. The intercepts do confirm that some of the conversations described in the dossier took place between the same individuals on the same days and from the same locations as detailed in the dossier. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/10/politics/russia-dossier-update/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;Russia considers returning Snowden to U.S. to “curry favor” with Trump&lt;/strong&gt;. Trump has called the NSA leaker a “spy” and a “traitor” who deserves to be executed. Russia considers turning over Snowden to be a “gift” to Trump. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/russia-eyes-sending-snowden-u-s-gift-trump-official-n718921&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;National security adviser Flynn discussed sanctions with Russian ambassador, despite denials&lt;/strong&gt;. Flynn’s communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were interpreted by some senior U.S. officials as an inappropriate and potentially illegal signal to the Kremlin that it could expect a reprieve from sanctions that were being imposed by the Obama administration in late December to punish Russia for its alleged interference in the 2016 election. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/national-security-adviser-flynn-discussed-sanctions-with-russian-ambassador-despite-denials-officials-say/2017/02/09/f85b29d6-ee11-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did Mike Pence get burned by Michael Flynn?&lt;/strong&gt; Either the national security adviser misled the vice president, or the vice president knowingly misled the American people.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump tells President Xi Jinping U.S. will honor the “One China” Policy&lt;/strong&gt;, reversing his earlier expressions of doubt about the longtime diplomatic understanding and removing a major source of tension between the United States and China since shortly after he was elected. Trump had to publicly commit to upholding the 44-year-old policy for President Xi to take his call. The concession was clearly designed to put an end to an extended chill in the relationship between China and the United States. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/world/asia/donald-trump-china-xi-jinping-letter.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The US’s One-China policy explained&lt;/strong&gt;: It has been the policy of the United States to recognize Taiwan as part of China. The one-China policy is the delicate balance between respecting China’s claim to the territory and maintaining close ties to Taiwan.

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump’s retreat over Taiwan and China’s currency may be tactical&lt;/strong&gt;. Trump has threatened to label China a currency manipulator and to slap tariffs of as much as 45% on Chinese goods. If he follows through with that, the result could be a trade war that damages both economies. But, talking with China, rather than trading threats, could help Trump come away with some kind of deal on issues like import tariffs and currencies that he could tout as a victory.

&lt;p&gt;7/ &lt;strong&gt;Tom Price confirmed as the new secretary of Health and Human Services&lt;/strong&gt;. He was approved by a party-line vote of 52-47.

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.2 million people have signed up for Obamacare this year&lt;/strong&gt;, even with the uncertainty created by Trump’s vow to repeal and replace it. Enrollment is about 4 percent lower than last year, the sizable number of sign-ups illustrates the risk Republicans face as they begin moving to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and put in its place a yet-to-be-defined conservative approach.

But the math says the opposite.&lt;/strong&gt; Mnuchin said any rate reductions at the top would be offset by the closing of fat loopholes, his guarantee appears impossible to fulfill either under the tax overhaul that the House Republicans are pushing or similar, sketchier proposals that Mr. Trump has offered.

&lt;p&gt;11/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump vexed by challenges, scale of government&lt;/strong&gt;. The president’s allies say he has been surprised that government can’t be run like his business. Nearly two dozen people who’ve spent time with Trump in the three weeks since his inauguration said that his mood has careened between surprise and anger as he’s faced the predictable realities of governing, from congressional delays over his cabinet nominations and legal fights holding up his aggressive initiatives to staff in-fighting and leaks.

&lt;p&gt;12/ &lt;strong&gt;Republicans push bill to split up “nutty 9th Circuit”&lt;/strong&gt;. They argue that the 9th is too big, too liberal and too slow resolving cases.

Nevada, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Arizona, and Alaska would be part of the brand new 12th Circuit.

&lt;p&gt;13/ &lt;strong&gt;A blueprint for resistance to Trump has emerged.

The ruling was focused on the narrow question of whether the travel ban should be blocked while courts consider its lawfulness. The decision is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court.

He won’t be an attorney general who will side with those consigned by petty judges to cycles of poverty and crime, or those circulating in and out of a new generation of debtors’ prisons. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a52895/who-is-jeff-sessions-attorney-general/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Esquire&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;strong&gt;Republicans vote to rebuke Elizabeth Warren for impugning Sessions’s character&lt;/strong&gt;. In an extraordinarily rare move, Mitch McConnell interrupted Warren’s speech in a near-empty chamber, as debate on Jeff Sessions’s nomination, saying she had breached Senate rules by reading past statements against Sessions. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/02/07/republicans-vote-to-rebuke-elizabeth-warren-for-impugning-sessionss-character/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silencing Elizabeth Warren backfires on Senate GOP&lt;/strong&gt;. Warren went straight from the Senate floor to a call-in appearance on Rachel Maddow’s MSNBC show. Adding fuel to the backlash, supporters noted the apparent hypocrisy that Warren’s male colleagues were able to read from the letter uninterrupted. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/politics/elizabeth-warren-silenced/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Nevertheless, she persisted” becomes new battle cry after McConnell silences Elizabeth Warren&lt;/strong&gt;. If the Republican senators had intended to minimize Warren’s message, the decision backfired — severely. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/08/nevertheless-she-persisted-becomes-new-battle-cry-after-mcconnell-silences-elizabeth-warren/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;Appeals Court panel appears skeptical of Trump’s travel ban&lt;/strong&gt;. The appeals court judges seemed taken aback by the assertiveness of the administration’s position, which in places came close to saying the court was without power to make judgments about Trump’s actions. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/us/politics/trump-immigration-ban-hearing-appeal.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump decries “disgraceful” opposition as appeals court weighs immigration order&lt;/strong&gt;.

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gorsuch calls Trump’s tweets about the judiciary “demoralizing” and “disheartening” to the independence of the courts&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;House Republicans voted to eliminate the only federal agency that makes sure voting machines can’t be hacked&lt;/strong&gt;.  In a little-noticed 6-3 vote, the House Administration Committee voted along party lines to eliminate the Election Assistance Commission, which helps states run elections and is the only federal agency charged with making sure voting machines can’t be hacked.

&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump invites sheriff to “destroy” Texas state lawmaker who opposes asset forfeiture&lt;/strong&gt;, a practice by which law enforcement can seize the cash and property of individuals suspected of committing a crime without a guilty verdict. Proponents of the practice argue that allows law enforcement to effectively combat terrorism and the drug trade, while opponents, including some conservatives, argue that it allows police to seize assets without due process.

&lt;p&gt;6/ &lt;strong&gt;Leaks suggest Trump’s own team is alarmed by his conduct&lt;/strong&gt;: an impulsive, sometimes petty chief executive more concerned with the adulation of the nation than the details of his own policies ― and quick to assign blame when things do not go his way.

&lt;p&gt;7/ &lt;strong&gt;Yemen withdraws permission for U.S. antiterror ground missions&lt;/strong&gt; after the raid, in which just about everything went wrong, killed several civilians, including children. It was an early test of Trump’s national security decision-making. The White House continues to insist that the attack was a “success.” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/world/middleeast/yemen-special-operations-missions.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8/ &lt;strong&gt;US military to rent space in Trump Tower&lt;/strong&gt;. Military support for a president, including the military staff assigned to keeping the “nuclear football” nearby, requires close proximity to the commander in chief, which is why the Pentagon needs to rent a more expensive space closer to the penthouse where Trump resides when he’s in New York. The floors available to rent cost about $1.5 million a year.

&lt;p&gt;9/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump faults media while lying about murder rate&lt;/strong&gt;. Trump has suggested that the national news media suppresses bad news about violence. He has implied that this is for ideological reasons.

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump says his critics “pull out the racist card”&lt;/strong&gt; when they characterize him or his policies as anti-Muslim or anti-black. Trump also defended himself against criticism that he makes comments without factual evidence to support them, such as his unsubstantiated claim that millions of undocumented immigrants voted illegally. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/07/trump-says-his-critics-pull-out-the-racist-card/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conway clashes with CNN’s Jake Tapper on air&lt;/strong&gt;. Tapper pressed Conway sharply on Trump’s false claim that the U.S. murder rate is “the highest it’s been in 45 to 47 years.” Conway then tried to shift the conversation to the criticism she has received from media reports, while asserting that she’s “the most open press person in the White House.

&lt;p&gt;10/ &lt;strong&gt;Democrats to plot anti-Trump strategy in Congress and at the polls&lt;/strong&gt;. Democrats are thinking about how to capture the fast-growing wave of resistance to the Trump administration, as seen at congressional town halls, congressional offices, and airports since Trump was sworn. Trump is polling poorly across the country but stronger in swing seats.

&lt;p&gt;11/ &lt;strong&gt;White House weighs terrorist designation for Muslim Brotherhood&lt;/strong&gt;, targeting the oldest and perhaps most influential Islamist group in the Middle East.

&lt;p&gt;12/ &lt;strong&gt;Spicer: Nordstrom dropping Ivanka Trump’s line is “direct attack on Trump”&lt;/strong&gt;.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;9th Circuit Court of Appeals to hear challenge to Trump’s ban today&lt;/strong&gt;. The issue in front of the court at the moment is whether the ban will remain suspended for now. The hour-long hearing, conducted by telephone among three West coast judges at 6 p.m. ET, will determine the immediate fate of the nationwide temporary restraining order against Trump’s travel ban. The three-judge panel is expected to rule this week.

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“If something happens”: Trump points his finger in case of a terrorist attack&lt;/strong&gt;. President Trump appears to be laying the groundwork to preemptively shift blame for any future terrorist attack on U.S. soil from his administration to the federal judiciary, as well as to the media. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/if-something-happens-trump-points-his-finger-in-case-of-a-terror-attack/2017/02/06/8e315b78-eca6-11e6-9662-6eedf1627882_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

The states of Washington and Minnesota, which sued to block Trump’s order, are citing the president’s inflammatory rhetoric as evidence that the government’s claims — that it’s not a ban and not aimed at Muslims — are shams.

&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;WH official: We’ll say “fake news” until media realizes attitude of attacking the President is wrong&lt;/strong&gt;. Trump and his staff have repeatedly used the term “fake news” to discredit reporting on the administration, often offering no evidence to back up their disputes with those outlets’ stories.

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;InfoWars is behind President Trump’s idea that the media is covering up terrorist attacks&lt;/strong&gt;.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump will not be allowed to address Parliament on UK state visit&lt;/strong&gt;. Members of Parliament will not permit Trump to address Westminster Hall because of his racist and sexist attitudes.

&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;strong&gt;After 2 weeks of stumbles, Trump and staff rethink tactics&lt;/strong&gt;. The backlash against a series of executive orders has Trump and his top staff reconsidering their improvisational approach to governing. Trump, who was not fully briefed on the executive order he signed giving his chief strategist a seat on the National Security Council, has demanded that he be looped in earlier. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/05/us/politics/trump-white-house-aides-strategy.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We are moving big and we are moving fast,” Bannon said, when asked about the upheaval of the first two weeks. “We didn’t come here to do small things.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But one thing has become apparent to both his allies and his opponents: When it comes to governing, speed does not always guarantee success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;The massacre that wasn’t, and a turning point for fake news&lt;/strong&gt;. The Bowling Green episode made such a splash because it played directly into concerns that the Trump administration would use untrue assertions to rally support for its agenda while denigrating as “dishonest” all the valid reporting pointing out the falsehoods.

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democrats confront lefty fake news&lt;/strong&gt;. As opposition to President Trump consumes social media, Democrats are facing their own troubles with conspiracy theories and sketchy stories going viral. “It exists on the left and that’s a problem because it misinforms people.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/democrats-confront-lefty-fake-news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BuzzFeed New&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump is now speculating that the media is covering up terrorist attacks&lt;/strong&gt;. Trump went off his prepared remarks to make a truly stunning claim: The media was intentionally covering up reports of terrorist attacks and complicit in making terrorists successful. It’s part of a recent pattern of suggesting that others are standing in the way of his terrorism-fighting efforts, which includes disparaging a federal judge who halted his immigration executive order.

&lt;p&gt;7/ &lt;strong&gt;Kremlin says it wants apology from Fox News over Putin comments&lt;/strong&gt;. Fox News host Bill O’Reilly described Putin as “a killer” in the interview with Trump as he tried to press the U.S. president to explain more fully why he respected his Russian counterpart. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-foxnews-kremlin-idUSKBN15L0XC&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump’s continued defense of Putin confounds Republicans&lt;/strong&gt;. Congressional Republicans have broken with Trump over dozens of controversial statements he has made during his campaign, his transition and now his presidency. But few issues appear to have confounded lawmakers as much as his consistent defense of Putin. Trump’s coziness is at odds with years of Republican foreign policy orthodoxy calling for a more aggressive stance toward Putin’s regime. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-continued-defense-of-putin-confounds-republicans/2017/02/05/fc082ada-ebd1-11e6-b7e8-df81bd6c4c30_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8/ &lt;strong&gt;Senate Democrats plan to debate all night in hopes of stopping DeVos&lt;/strong&gt;. The 24-hour marathon of speeches is expected to conclude at noon on Tuesday, when the Senate is expected to vote on DeVos’ confirmation. That vote is likely to be a 50-50 tie, with Vice President Mike Pence then taking a rare tiebreaker vote to ensure that DeVos is confirmed. The debate is not a filibuster.

&lt;p&gt;9/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump speaks of “strong support” for NATO in call with leaders&lt;/strong&gt;. Trump pressed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s general secretary on how to encourage member nations to pay more for their defense while expressing “strong support” from the U.S. for the alliance (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-02-06/trump-speaks-of-strong-support-for-nato-in-call-with-leader&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;Appeals court rejects request to immediately restore travel ban&lt;/strong&gt;. A federal appeals court early Sunday rejected a request by the Justice Department to immediately restore President Trump’s immigration order. The ruling meant that refugees and travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations would, for now, continue to be able to enter the country. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/us/politics/visa-ban-trump-judge-james-robart.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A judge in a lower federal court had put a temporary stop to the travel ban. Because the appeals court declined to intervene immediately, affected travelers can enter until at least until Monday. The appeals court set a schedule asking challengers to the ban to file a response by roughly 3 a.m. Eastern on Monday, and the Justice Department — representing the Trump administration — to reply to that by 6 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Trump administration had said it was improper for a lower court to engage in “second-guessing” of President Trump’s controversial immigration order and asked the appeals court to dissolve the judge’s order that stopped its implementation. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-appeals-to-restore-travel-ban-says-earlier-ruling-was-second-guessing-the-president/2017/02/05/6fcdbb5a-eb4c-11e6-80c2-30e57e57e05d_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens if Trump decides to ignore a judge’s ruling. If Trump were to ever go down this road&lt;/strong&gt;, the ultimate arbiter would be the other branch of government. He said Trump could be held in contempt of court, and it would then be up to the House of Representatives. the Trump administration has given no indication that they’ll actually ignore this particular court order.

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From “drain the swamp” to Government Sachs&lt;/strong&gt;. Although Trump campaigned as an economic populist, his brand of populism was simply old-school Reaganomics—giveaways to the rich and pro-corporate deregulation—rebranded with a nationalist and protectionist twist. After the election, Trump stocked his Cabinet with Wall Street billionaires and mega-millionaires—Wilbur Ross, Steve Mnuchin, Cohn—who had benefitted personally from the lax regulatory regime that was in place before 2010.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;Homeland Security suspends travel ban&lt;/strong&gt;, and will resume standard inspections of travelers as it did prior to the signing of the travel ban. The White House announced the Justice Department would file an emergency motion to stop the halt, but it had yet to do so as of Saturday afternoon. Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said he was prepared to take his case all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/03/politics/federal-judge-temporarily-halts-trump-travel-ban-nationwide-ag-says/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On Friday night, a federal judge in Seattle temporarily halted the enforcement of President Trump’s executive order on immigration. By Saturday, federal officials had announced they would be complying with the ruling, and airlines said they would resume boarding travelers covered under the ban.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump badgered, bragged and abruptly ended phone call with Australian leader&lt;/strong&gt;. Trump blasted Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over a refu­gee agreement and boasted about the magnitude of his electoral college win. Trump called it “this was the worst call by far.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/no-gday-mate-on-call-with-australian-pm-trump-badgers-and-brags/2017/02/01/88a3bfb0-e8bf-11e6-80c2-30e57e57e05d_story.html&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump had heated exchange with Australian PM, talked ‘tough hombres’ with Mexican leader.&lt;/strong&gt; The disagreement came as the two leaders discussed a deal, reached under the Obama administration, for the US to accept refugees from Australia who are living on islands in detention centers off the mainland due to strict government policies. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/politics/malcolm-turnbull-donald-trump-pena-nieto/&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump tells Israel to hold off on building new settlements&lt;/strong&gt;, saying new settlements “may not help” achieve Middle East peace. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/world/middleeast/iran-missile-test-trump.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The statement marks a more nuanced position in what has been Trump’s consistently pro-Israel stance. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/02/in-a-potential-shift-trump-warns-israel-that-new-settlements-may-not-help-achieve-middle-east-peace/&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;Tehran shrugs off pressures from “inexperienced” U.S. president&lt;/strong&gt;. Trump and Iran traded sharp statements Thursday, with Trump amplifying warnings over Tehran’s missile tests. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/with-flynn-putting-iran-on-notice-the-first-days-of-president-trumps-foreign-policy-set-a-combative-tone/2017/02/01/0645f248-e709-11e6-b82f-687d6e6a3e7c_story.html&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. expected to impose fresh sanctions on Iranian entities&lt;/strong&gt;, following Tehran’s recent ballistic missile test. Trump said earlier on Thursday that “nothing is off the table” in dealing with Iran following the missile launch. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-iran-sanctions-idUSKBN15H2OE&quot;&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spicer falsely accuses Iran of attacking U.S. Navy vessel, calling it an act of war&lt;/strong&gt;. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn said he was “officially putting Iran on notice” following the country’s ballistic missile test and an attack on a Saudi naval vessel – Iran did not attack a U.S. Navy vessel. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2017/02/02/press-secretary-sean-spicer-falsely-accuses-iran-of-attacking-u-s-navy-vessel-an-act-of-war/&quot;&gt;The Intercept&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;House rolls back rule restricting gun sales to severely mentally ill&lt;/strong&gt;. Republicans are using the Congressional Review Act to roll back all manner of regulations. Rep. Kevin Brady said the Social Security Administration “overstepped its mission.” The vote was 235-180. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/02/politics/house-vote-guns-mental-illnesses/index.html&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;Scott Pruitt, Trump’s E.P.A. pick, is approved by Senate committee&lt;/strong&gt;. Senate Republicans pressed forward with the confirmation of Trump’s controversial nominee, suspending the Environment and Public Works Committee’s rules to approve the cabinet pick despite a Democratic boycott. The 11-0 vote sends the nomination to the full Senate, where Mr. Pruitt is most likely to be approved next week. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/us/politics/scott-pruitt-epa-senate.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6/ &lt;strong&gt;Democrats plot protest for Trump’s speech to Congress&lt;/strong&gt;. Democrats are planning to make Trump’s first speech to Congress as uncomfortable as possible by inviting guests they say will suffer under new White House policies. Trump will likely face a crowd including ethnic minorities, LGBT people, undocumented immigrants, the disabled and others when he addresses a joint session on Feb. 28. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/homenews/house/317473-democrats-plot-protest-for-trumps-speech-to-congress&quot;&gt;The Hill&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump vows to “totally destroy” law restricting political speech by tax-exempt churches&lt;/strong&gt;, a potentially huge victory for the religious right and a gesture to his political base. Repealing the law would require approval by Congress. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/us/politics/trump-johnson-amendment-political-activity-churches.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump at national prayer breakfast: “Pray for Arnold… for those ratings”&lt;/strong&gt;. Trump veered off script at the start of the National Prayer Breakfast Thursday when he asked a room full of lawmakers, foreign dignitaries and religious leaders to pray for Arnold Schwarzenegger so that ratings of his show – NBC’s “The Apprentice” – would go up. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/02/politics/donald-trump-national-prayer-breakfast/&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leaked draft of Trump’s religious freedom order reveals sweeping plans to legalize discrimination&lt;/strong&gt;. If signed, the order would create wholesale exemptions for people and organizations who claim religious objections to same-sex marriage, premarital sex, abortion, and trans identity.

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8/ &lt;strong&gt;An anti-Trump resistance movement is growing within the government.&lt;/strong&gt; The bureaucracy is fighting back. While dissent among federal workers isn’t unique to the Trump era, the scope of the resistance is unprecedented.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9/ &lt;strong&gt;Still no executive order on voter fraud, as Trump moves on.&lt;/strong&gt; A full week has passed since President Donald Trump said he would sign an executive order opening a Justice Department investigation into his unsubstantiated claim that millions of people voted illegally in November. The Oval Office signing was abruptly canceled and never rescheduled. The White House hasn’t talked about it since. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/02/politics/trump-voter-fraud-executive-order/index.html&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10/ &lt;strong&gt;The G.O.P. campaign to repeal Obamacare hits a wall&lt;/strong&gt;. Republicans are struggling to come up with a replacement and a key senator has declared that the effort is more a repair job than a demolition.

&lt;p&gt;11/ &lt;strong&gt;Shouting match over Russia erupts at House hearing over Russian interference in the presidential election.&lt;/strong&gt; Th fight exposed bitter frustration amongst Democrats that Republicans have kept the issue locked in a single committee.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump Picks Neil Gorsuch, A Scalia Clone, For The Supreme Court.&lt;/strong&gt; Ideologically, Gorsuch would almost certainly represent a reliably conservative vote and voice. Gorsuch would be the most conservative justice save for the silent stalwart Justice Clarence Thomas and would sit somewhere just to the right of the ideological space occupied by Scalia. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-trump/&quot;&gt;FiveThirtyEight&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UPDATE: &lt;strong&gt;What Gorsuch means for the Supreme Court&lt;/strong&gt;. 13 top legal scholars weigh in. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/02/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-future-214724&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where Gorsuch would fit on the Supreme Court&lt;/strong&gt;. Should he be confirmed, the court will return to a familiar dynamic, with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy holding the decisive vote in many closely divided cases. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/31/us/politics/trump-supreme-court-nominee.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Is Neil Gorsuch?&lt;/strong&gt; Like Justice Antonin Scalia, Gorsuch has cultivated a reputation as a memorable and clear author of legal opinions. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2017/01/31/511850519/who-is-neil-gorsuch-trumps-first-pick-for-the-supreme-court&quot;&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Liberals should back Gorsuch.&lt;/strong&gt; One basic criterion should be paramount: Is the nominee someone who will stand up for the rule of law and say no to a president or Congress that strays beyond the Constitution and laws? (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/opinion/why-liberals-should-back-neil-gorsuch.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Democrats should oppose Gorsuch.&lt;/strong&gt; The presumption should be that Gorsuch does not deserve confirmation, because the process that led to his nomination was illegitimate. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/opinion/neil-gorsuch-how-democrats-should-respond.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump to McConnell: Go nuclear if necessary&lt;/strong&gt;. But McConnell, a well-known institutionalist, has been noncommittal about whether he would invoke the so-called “nuclear option” to force Gorsuch through the upper chamber. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/317348-trump-to-mcconnell-go-nuclear-if-necessary&quot;&gt;The Hill&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Republicans nuke the filibuster to confirm Gorsuch.&lt;/strong&gt; Once Mitch McConnell blockaded Barack Obama’s last Supreme Court nomination, and then Donald Trump carried the Electoral College, the chance that Republicans would fill the vacancy rose to 100 percent. McConnell already indicated that he does not respect Democrats’ right to filibuster, and that he would eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations if one is used. It is McConnell, his extraordinary blockade tactic, who has functionally changed the rules of the game. He should be forced to do it in name. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/make-republicans-nuke-the-filibuster-to-confirm-gorsuch.html&quot;&gt;New York Magazine&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;Rex Tillerson is confirmed as Secretary of State amid record opposition&lt;/strong&gt;. The votes against Mr. Tillerson’s confirmation were the most in Senate history (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/us/politics/rex-tillerson-secretary-of-state-confirmed.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;Sessions approved by Senate committee.&lt;/strong&gt; The Senate Judiciary Committee approved Sessions 11-9 along party lines. His nomination now goes to the floor, where he is widely expected to be confirmed given the GOP’s 52-seat majority. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/317035-sessions-approved-by-senate-committee&quot;&gt;The Hill&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;Republicans suspend committee rules, advance Mnuchin, Price nominations&lt;/strong&gt; after confronting a boycott from Democrats. Senate Committee rules normally require at least one Democratic senator present to have a vote. But when Democrats refused to show, the committee’s chairman suspended those rules. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/politics/republicans-vote-to-suspend-committee-rules-advance-mnuchin-price-nominations/&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6/ &lt;strong&gt;Two Republican senators says they aren’t committed to voting for Betsy DeVos&lt;/strong&gt; on Senate floor. Democrats say they have 48 votes against DeVos on the floor but need 51 — and they have been looking for Republican votes against her. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/01/31/two-republican-senators-says-they-arent-committed-to-voting-for-betsy-devos-on-senate-floor/&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two GOP senators to vote no on Betsy DeVos&lt;/strong&gt;. The first two Republicans to break with Trump on his Cabinet picks. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/317379-gop-senator-to-vote-no-on-betsy-devos&quot;&gt;The Hill&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DeVos nomination stands at 50-50&lt;/strong&gt;. It could come down to Vice President Mike Pence, in what would be a history-making confirmation vote.

    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7/ &lt;strong&gt;Resistance from within: Federal workers push back against Trump.&lt;/strong&gt; Less than two weeks into Trump’s administration, federal workers are in regular consultation with recently departed Obama-era political appointees about what they can do to push back against the new president’s initiatives. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/resistance-from-within-federal-workers-push-back-against-trump/2017/01/31/c65b110e-e7cb-11e6-b82f-687d6e6a3e7c_story.html&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bannon explained his worldview well before it became official U.S. policy:&lt;/strong&gt; countries should protect their citizens and their essence by reducing immigration, legal and illegal, and pulling back from multinational agreements. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bannon-explained-his-worldview-well-before-it-became-official-us-policy/2017/01/31/2f4102ac-e7ca-11e6-80c2-30e57e57e05d_story.html&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Democrats missed a chance to reshape the Supreme Court for a generation.&lt;/strong&gt; If it weren’t for 77,744 voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, the Supreme Court would have had, for the first time in nearly 50 years, a majority of Democratic-appointed justices.

   <title>Day 12: Controversy.</title>
   <link href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/01/31/Day-12/"/>
   <updated>2017-01-31T00:00:00-08:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;Hill staffers secretly worked on Trump’s immigration order.&lt;/strong&gt; Several House Judiciary Committee aides helped craft the controversial directive without telling Republican leaders. The news of their involvement helps unlock the mystery of whether the White House consulted Capitol Hill about the executive order, and confirms that the small group of staffers were among the only people on the Hill who knew of the looming controversial policy. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-immigration-congress-order-234392&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UPDATE: San Francisco sues Trump over executive orders it claims are unconstitutional. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-san-francisco-trump-20170131-story.html&quot;&gt;LA Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Draft executive order points to more immigration restrictions, focusing on protecting U.S. jobs.&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration is considering a plan to weed out would-be immigrants who are likely to require public assistance, as well as to deport — when possible — immigrants already living in the United States who depend on taxpayer help. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administration-circulates-more-draft-immigration-restrictions-focusing-on-protecting-us-jobs/2017/01/31/38529236-e741-11e6-80c2-30e57e57e05d_story.html&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump’s travel ban polarizes America.&lt;/strong&gt;  A Jan. 30-31 Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll found that 49 percent of American adults said they either “strongly” or “somewhat” agreed with Trump’s order, while 41 percent “strongly” or “somewhat” disagreed and another 10 percent said they don’t know.

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under fire, Trump weighs new changes to refugee ban.&lt;/strong&gt; The Department of Homeland Security may issue “implementation guidance” that would allow for softening, and even policy changes, to the travel restrictions on migrants. The White House insists that any further guidance wouldn’t constitute a walk-back. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/under-fire-trump-weighs-new-changes-to-refugee-ban-2227749820.html&quot;&gt;Axios&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;strong&gt;Obama’s protections for L.G.B.T. workers will remain.&lt;/strong&gt; The White House said Trump would leave in place a 2014 order that created new protections for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, pledging to protect the community from violence and oppression. It uses stronger language than any Republican president has before in favor of equal legal protections for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UPDATE: &lt;strong&gt;Dems delay Sessions vote.&lt;/strong&gt; Democrats have fiercely criticized Trump’s executive order and Yates’s firing, and said that any vote for Sessions is a vote to let Trump stifle dissent in his Justice Department. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/317135-dems-delay-sessions-vote&quot;&gt;The Hill&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Senate Democrats renewed an assault on Donald Trump’s pick for attorney general&lt;/strong&gt;, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, questioning his independence after the president fired the acting attorney general for refusing to enforce his executive order on immigration.

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to build an autocracy.&lt;/strong&gt; The preconditions are present in the U.S. today.

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The incompetence displayed by Trump’s immigration orders will be terrifying in a crisis.&lt;/strong&gt; All presidents eventually face a crisis that is not of their own creation.

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump fires acting attorney general&lt;/strong&gt;, after she defiantly refused to defend his immigration executive order. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/us/politics/trump-immigration-ban-memo.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;White House said the attorney general had “betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/acting-attorney-general-an-obama-administration-holdover-wont-defend-trump-immigration-order/2017/01/30/a9846f02-e727-11e6-b82f-687d6e6a3e7c_story.html&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;Democrats prepare bill to overturn Trump immigration order.&lt;/strong&gt; The bill would declare the order “null and void” and bar federal agencies from using any funds to enforce it.

   <title>Day 10: Embarrassment.</title>
   <link href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/01/29/Day-10/"/>
   <updated>2017-01-29T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/01/29/Day-10</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump’s first defeat.&lt;/strong&gt; The immigration order creates an international mess and a political embarrassment. The hastily crafted order was temporarily and partially blocked by a U.S. District Court Judge. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/president-trumps-first-defeat-214707&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UPDATE: &lt;strong&gt;Trump doubles down on his executive order barring refugees&lt;/strong&gt; and some legal immigrants from entering the United States, even as one of his top aides walked back one major element of the order, signaling a growing sense of confusion and fissures within the 10-day-old administration. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-refugees-234320&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Bannon’s longtime suspicion of successful immigrants is the key to this weekend’s chaos. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vox.com/2017/1/29/14429984/trump-immigration-order-steve-bannon&quot;&gt;Vox&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;strong&gt;Despite growing dissent, Trump gives no sign of backing down from travel ban&lt;/strong&gt; even as lawmakers from both parties spoke out against the action and federal judges ruled against parts of it. Judicial rulings in several cities across the country overnight immediately blocked enforcement of the ban to various degrees, but the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement early Sunday indicating it would continue to implement President Trump’s action. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/trump-gives-no-sign-of-backing-down-from-travel-ban/2017/01/29/4ffe900a-e620-11e6-b82f-687d6e6a3e7c_story.html&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UPDATE: &lt;strong&gt;271 Republicans in Congress have taken no position on Trump’s refugee ban.&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vox.com/2017/1/29/14427466/republican-congress-silent-trump-refugee&quot;&gt;Vox&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Trump approval rating: 42% (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gallup.com/poll/201617/gallup-daily-trump-job-approval.aspx&quot;&gt;Gallup&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;A clarifying moment in American history.&lt;/strong&gt; There should be nothing surprising about what the Donald Trump has done in his first week, but he had underestimated the resilience of Americans and their institutions. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/a-clarifying-moment-in-american-history/514868/&quot;&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump, the refugee ban, and the triumph of cruelty.&lt;/strong&gt; The reasons for Trump’s ban on refugees could not be more feeble, and could not be more petty. It serves no actual security purpose. You have a better chance of getting killed by a train, or by your own clothes catching on fire, than by an immigrant terrorist attack. The odds of a refugee killing you in a terrorist strike are about 1 in 3.6 billion. That’s about four hundred times less likely than being hit by lightning twice. If you look back at significant terrorist attacks in the US like San Bernardino or the Pulse nightclub shooting or 9/11, exactly none of them would have been prevented by this policy. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vox.com/2017/1/28/14425354/donald-trump-cruelty&quot;&gt;Vox&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump puts Bannon on security council, dropping joint chiefs.&lt;/strong&gt; The reshuffling of the National Security Council downgrades the military chiefs and gives a regular seat to his chief strategist Steve Bannon. The director of national intelligence and the joint chiefs will attend when discussions pertain to their areas. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38787241&quot;&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump chief-of-staff Reince Priebus will also have a seat in the meetings. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/28/lobbying-ban-trump-executive-order-isis-strategy&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UPDATE: McCain blasts Bannon placement on National Security Council,calling the move “radical” because it minimizes the role of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/mccain-bannon-nsc-234329&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump signs two more executive actions.&lt;/strong&gt; The first bans administration officials who leave government from lobbying those federal agencies for five years, fulfilling a campaign pledge. The second is a memorandum giving military leaders 30 days to construct and present a “comprehensive plan to defeat ISIS,” stating that “there can be no accommodation or negotiation” with the group. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/316701-admin-trump-to-issue-three-more-executive-orders&quot;&gt;The Hill&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump’s state department purge sparks worries of ‘know-nothing approach’ to foreign policy.&lt;/strong&gt; The sudden dismissal of several senior officials has left a gaping hole at the heart of US diplomacy: “The machinery is still there, but no one’s in the cockpit.” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/29/state-department-purge-trump-foreign-policy&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump continued his longstanding assault on media outlets.&lt;/strong&gt; This time labeling the NY Times as “fake news,” and said that it and the Washington Post’s coverage of Trump has been “so false and angry.” It is unclear as to what prompted Trump’s criticism. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-calls-the-new-york-times-washington-post-dishonest-234304&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The malevolence of President Trump’s Executive Order on visas and refugees is mitigated chiefly – and perhaps only – by the astonishing incompetence of its drafting and construction.&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://lawfareblog.com/malevolence-tempered-incompetence-trumps-horrifying-executive-order-refugees-and-visas&quot;&gt;Lawfare&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump’s order blocks immigrants at airports, stoking fear around the globe.&lt;/strong&gt; The executive order suspended entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely, and blocked entry into the United States for 90 days for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security said that the executive order also barred green card holders from those countries from re-entering the United States. White House officials said that green card holders from the seven affected countries who are outside the United States would need a case-by-case waiver to return to the United States. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; A federal judge in Brooklyn came to the aid of scores of refugees who were trapped at airports across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The judge’s ruling blocked part of the president’s actions, preventing the government from deporting some arrivals who found themselves ensnared by the presidential order. But it stopped short of letting them into the country or issuing a broader ruling on the constitutionality of Trump’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;strong&gt;A federal judge issued a stay against Donald Trump’s “Muslim Ban”.&lt;/strong&gt; The ruling – a stunning defeat for Trump at the end of his first week in office – protects from deportation refugees or visa holders who were detained at American airports since the signing of so-called “Muslim ban.” It also protects those in transit when the emergency ruling was filed. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/muslim-ban-federal-court&quot;&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;Inside the confusion of the Trump executive order and travel ban.&lt;/strong&gt; Administration officials weren’t immediately sure which countries’ citizens would be barred from entering the United States. The Department of Homeland Security was left making a legal analysis on the order after Trump signed it. A Border Patrol agent, confronted with arriving refugees, referred questions only to the President himself, according to court filings. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/donald-trump-travel-ban/index.html&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;Facing intense criticism, some Republicans are speaking out against Trump’s refugee ban.&lt;/strong&gt; Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell aren’t among them. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/paul-ryan-trumps-refugee-ban-does-not-target-muslims/2017/01/28/e0cf1fe4-e56e-11e6-a547-5fb9411d332c_story.html&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6/ &lt;strong&gt;The silence from Silicon Valley had been deafening.&lt;/strong&gt; After weeks of deafening silence and quiet acquiescence, top tech leaders finally began to react strongly to policies of the new administration, spurred by a capricious immigration ban on some Muslim countries ordered by Trump. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recode.net/2017/1/28/14426422/tech-leaders-opposing-trumps-muslim-ban&quot;&gt;Recode&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7/ &lt;strong&gt;‘Up Is Down’: Trump’s unreality show echoes his business past.&lt;/strong&gt; Trump’s falsehoods have long been viewed as a reflexive extension of his vanity, or as his method of compensating for deep-seated insecurities. But throughout his business career, Trump’s most noteworthy deceptions often did double duty, serving not just his ego but also important strategic goals. Mr. Trump’s habitually inflated claims about his wealth, for example, fed his self-proclaimed image of a business genius even as they attracted lucrative licensing deals built around the Trump brand.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump executive order suspends admission of all refugees for 120 days&lt;/strong&gt; while a new system is put in place to tighten vetting for those from predominantly Muslim countries and give preference to religious minorities.

&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;The order will block 500,000 legal U.S. residents from returning to American from trips abroad.&lt;/strong&gt; The president has also used language that will affect those who are in the U.S. already on visas and green cards. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america/&quot;&gt;ProPublica&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump’s immigration ban excludes countries with business ties.&lt;/strong&gt; His proposed list doesn’t include Muslim-majority countries where his Trump Organization has done business or pursued potential deals. Properties include golf courses in the United Arab Emirates and two luxury towers operating in Turkey. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-trump-immigration-ban-conflict-of-interest/&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump’s immigration ban is illegal.&lt;/strong&gt; More than 50 years ago, Congress outlawed such discrimination against immigrants based on national origin. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/opinion/trumps-immigration-ban-is-illegal.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6/ &lt;strong&gt;Following Trump’s executive order green card, visa holders already blocked by airports.&lt;/strong&gt; Within hours of the executive order limiting immigration from Muslim countries, green card and visa holders were already being blocked from getting on flights to the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security issued a directive at 4:30 p.m. ordering the Customs and Border Protection to enforce the executive order. People who were still in the air as of 10:30 p.m. likely face being blocked at the airport when their planes land, he said. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-order-blocks-green-card-visa-holders-airports-article-1.2957910&quot;&gt;NY Daily News&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7/ &lt;strong&gt;A little-noticed move by Trump could make it easier to deport immigrants.&lt;/strong&gt; The move stripped federal privacy protections from many immigrants, raising fears among advocacy groups that information people willingly submitted to the federal government during the Obama administration could now be used to help deport them. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/a-little-noticed-move-by-trump-could-make-it-easier-to-deport-immigrants/2017/01/27/fd5734ec-e4cb-11e6-a453-19ec4b3d09ba_story.html&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8/ &lt;strong&gt;Governing without a script.&lt;/strong&gt; Trumps seems to be running his administration much like he ran his company and campaign, eager to weigh in on every issue and willing to make last-minute calls. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-first-week-governing-without-a-script-1485544924&quot;&gt;Wall Stree Journal&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump blows up the U.S.-Mexico relationship.&lt;/strong&gt; In one of his first instances of Twitter diplomacy as President, Trump wrote, “If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.” Not surprisingly, Peña Nieto cancelled. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-blows-up-the-u-s-mexico-relationship&quot;&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10/ &lt;strong&gt;The theater of access.&lt;/strong&gt; Trump’s relationship with the media may be obsessive, but it’s also deeply transactional — the media has always been a tool in his pursuit of fame and power. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/magazine/donald-trump-and-the-theater-of-access.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11/ &lt;strong&gt;The Bannon coup.&lt;/strong&gt; White House and Hill GOP leaders are astonished by the unambiguous, far-reaching power of Steve Bannon and policy guru Stephen Miller over, well, just about everything.(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.axios.com/the-bannon-coup-2218491076.html&quot;&gt;Axios&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump’s first seven days in office were historic, chaotic, astonishing and unsettling.&lt;/strong&gt; With a flurry of provocative executive orders, surreal events, unapologetic falsehoods and did-he-really-say-that tweets, Trump continued to obliterate political norms, serving notice that the gaze of history won’t change who he is. He made so much news and did so many unorthodox things that it was hard to keep track of everything that was changing in Washington. The question, though, is what did all that sound and fury signify? (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/president-trump-week-one-first-administration-214699&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13/ &lt;strong&gt;Republican lawmakers fret about how to repeal Obamacare.&lt;/strong&gt; Republican lawmakers aired sharp concerns about their party’s quick push to repeal the Affordable Care Act inside a closed-door meeting Thursday, according to a recording of the session obtained by The Washington Post. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/behind-closed-doors-republican-lawmakers-fret-about-how-to-repeal-obamacare/2017/01/27/deabdafa-e491-11e6-a547-5fb9411d332c_story.html&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14/ &lt;strong&gt;Pence vows “full evaluation of voting rolls” over claims of fraud.&lt;/strong&gt; In a private meeting with congressional Republicans this week, the Trump administration would pursue a wide-ranging probe of voting rolls in the United States to examine whether millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election as President Trump has charged. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/in-private-meeting-pence-vows-full-evaluation-of-voting-rolls-over-claims-of-voting-fraud/2017/01/27/1c1fa1de-e49a-11e6-a547-5fb9411d332c_story.html&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15/ &lt;strong&gt;Can a president who disregards the truth uphold his oath of office?&lt;/strong&gt; His job demands a basic level of respect for the concepts of law and meaning. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/01/27/can-a-president-who-disregards-the-truth-uphold-his-oath-of-office/&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump backers like his first draft of a New America.&lt;/strong&gt; Trump voters interviewed said they cared little if the president spouted off on Twitter because he was issuing the kind of executive actions many had long craved — freezing federal grant money for environmental research, banning foreign aid for groups that give abortion counseling and cutting off immigration from several Muslim-majority nations. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/trump-backers-like-his-first-draft-of-a-new-america.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 7: Shut it.</title>
   <link href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/01/26/Day-7/"/>
   <updated>2017-01-26T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/01/26/Day-7</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;Steve Bannon says media should “keep its mouth shut.”&lt;/strong&gt; Trump’s chief strategist, laced into the American press during an interview, arguing that news organizations had been “humiliated” by an election outcome few anticipated, and repeatedly describing the media as “the opposition party” of the current administration. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/business/media/stephen-bannon-trump-news-media.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;strong&gt;One of the greatest threats Trump poses is that he corrupts and corrodes the absoluteness of truth, facts and science.&lt;/strong&gt; It is no coincidence that the rise of Trump is concurrent with the rise of “fake news.” It is no coincidence that his rise comes during an age of severely damaged faith in institutions. Our president is a pathological liar. Say it. Write it. Never become inured to it. And dispense with the terms of art to describe it. A lie by any other name portends the same. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/opinion/a-lie-by-any-other-name.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;Fake news is about to get even scarier than you ever dreamed.&lt;/strong&gt; What we saw in the 2016 election is nothing compared to what we need to prepare for in 2020. If there’s one thing we learned from this election cycle, it is that there are a number of reasons that people create fake-news stories. And, it has become clear that most new consumers don’t want to know if what they are reading is real or fake; they just want to know that it helps support their worldview. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/01/fake-news-technology&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;The State Department’s entire senior management team resigned.&lt;/strong&gt; Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s job running the State Department just got considerably more difficult. The entire senior level of management officials resigned as part of an ongoing mass exodus of senior Foreign Service officers who don’t want to stick around for the Trump era. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2017/01/26/the-state-departments-entire-senior-management-team-just-resigned/&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;The Trump administration’s day one moves were copied from Mitt Romney’s would-be playbook.&lt;/strong&gt; Literally. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/the-trump-administrations-day-one-moves-were-copied-from-mit&quot;&gt;Buzzfeed&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump pressured Park Service to find proof for his claims about inauguration crowd.&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-pressured-park-service-to-back-up-his-claims-about-inauguration-crowd/2017/01/26/12a38cb8-e3fc-11e6-ba11-63c4b4fb5a63_story.html&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7/ &lt;strong&gt;(The cost of) Trump’s wall keeps getting higher and higher.&lt;/strong&gt; Republican Congressional leaders signaled plans to move forward with Trump’s planned border wall, estimated to cost between $12 billion and $15 billion. That’s well below many outside estimates of the construction cost (let alone maintenance), but is significantly higher than what Trump himself has said in the past. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/the-cost-of-trumps-wall-keepss-getting-higher-and-higher-2216737417.html&quot;&gt;Axios&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8/ &lt;strong&gt;Americans think Trump will be worst president since Nixon.&lt;/strong&gt; Voters are so dim on Trump that they think, in the first week of his administration, that he will prove to be a worse President than everyone who’s held the office since Richard Nixon. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2017/01/americans-think-trump-will-be-worst-president-since-nixon.html&quot;&gt;Public Policy Polling&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; The full (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ppppolls/status/824652678005424130&quot;&gt;tweetstorm&lt;/a&gt;) that ends with this whopper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;And finally by a 42/39 spread Trump voters think he should be allowed to have a private email server: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/0kvoEMK527&quot;&gt;https://t.co/0kvoEMK527&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PublicPolicyPolling (@ppppolls) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ppppolls/status/824665530934194180&quot;&gt;January 26, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Day 6: Declining trust.</title>
   <link href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/01/25/Day-6/"/>
   <updated>2017-01-25T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/01/25/Day-6</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump’s voter fraud example?&lt;/strong&gt; A troubled tale about Bernhard Langer meant to illustrate rampant, unchecked voter fraud. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/trump-bernhard-langer-voting-fraud.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; Langer was standing in line at a polling place on Election Day. Ahead of and behind Langer were voters who “did not look as if they should be allowed to vote.” Langer left feeling frustrated. &lt;em&gt;Here’s the problem:&lt;/em&gt; Langer, who lives in Boca Raton, Fla., is a German citizen with permanent residence status in the United States who is, by law, barred from voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;strong&gt;Declining trust in government is denting democracy.&lt;/strong&gt; America, which has long defined itself as a standard-bearer of democracy for the world, has become a “flawed democracy” according to the taxonomy used in the annual Democracy Index from the Economist Intelligence Unit. Although its score did not fall by much – from 8.05 in 2015 to 7.98 in 2016 – it was enough for it to slip just below the 8.00 threshold for a “full democracy”. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/01/daily-chart-20&quot;&gt;The Economist&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump’s impulses now carry the force of the presidency.&lt;/strong&gt; Impetuous and instinctive, convinced of broad, but hidden plots to undermine him, eager to fight and prone to what an aide called “alternative facts,” Trump has shown in just days in office that he is like few if any occupants of the White House before him. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/donald-trump-presidency.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;Those flashy executive actions could run aground.&lt;/strong&gt; The White House failed to consult with many of the agencies and lawmakers who will be critical for their success. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trumps-flashy-executive-actions-could-run-aground-234200&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5/ Oh, and &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump is building his wall on the Mexico border as undocumented crossing reaches a 40-year low.&lt;/strong&gt; In taking his first step towards building a US-Mexico border wall, Trump begins an attack on a vanishing issue. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/894606/trumps-executive-order-to-build-a-us-mexico-border-wall-attacks-a-vanishing-issue/&quot;&gt;Quartz&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 5: Command and control.</title>
   <link href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/01/24/Day-5/"/>
   <updated>2017-01-24T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/01/24/Day-5</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump believes millions voted illegally – but provides no proof.&lt;/strong&gt; The claim has long been debunked. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/24/politics/wh-trump-believes-millions-voted-illegally/&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump orders the construction of a Mexican border wall.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s the first in a series of actions to curtail immigration and bolster national security. It includes slashing the number of refugees who can resettle in the United States and blocks Syrians and others from “terror prone” nations from entering  temporarily. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/us/politics/wall-border-trump.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;Federal works told to stop talking to Congress and the press.&lt;/strong&gt; The freeze has startled aides on the Hill and people at those agencies, who worry that it could abruptly upend current operations and stifle work and discussions that routinely take place between branches of government. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-communication-freeze_us_58878b3ae4b0441a8f7114e2&quot;&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump has imposed a freeze on grants and contracts by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-administration-imposes-freeze-on-epa-grants-and-contracts&quot;&gt;ProPublica&lt;/a&gt;) Trump also banned employees from giving social media updates and speaking with reporters. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/315876-trump-bans-epa-employees-from-giving-social-media-updates&quot;&gt;The Hill&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;USDA scientists have been put on lockdown.&lt;/strong&gt; “Starting immediately and until further notice” the department’s main research division “will not release any public-facing documents,” according to an internal memo. UPDATE: The order was rescinded by the department on Tuesday. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/legacy_mobile/dinograndoni/trump-usda&quot;&gt;Buzzfeed&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6/ &lt;strong&gt;USDA disavows gag-order emailed to scientific research unit.&lt;/strong&gt; An internal email sent to staff at its Agricultural Research Service unit this week calling for a suspension of “public-facing documents,” including news releases and photos, was flawed and that new guidance has been sent out to replace it. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-usda-idUSKBN1582OB&quot;&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7/ &lt;strong&gt;A National Park deleted tweets on climate change after Trump silenced federal scientists.&lt;/strong&gt; The tweets were posted by a former employee and officials decided to delete them because the account had been “compromised,” a National Parks official said. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/claudiakoerner/a-national-park-is-tweeting-facts-about-climate-change-in-de&quot;&gt;Buzzfeed&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8/ &lt;strong&gt;GOP Rep.: ‘Better to get your news directly from the president.”&lt;/strong&gt; The chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee said that Donald Trump was a more credible news source than the entire press corps. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/lamar-smith-trump-liberal-media&quot;&gt;Talking Points Memo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spicer: The media “disposition should be” Trump is correct “unless we can prove otherwise”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“…at some point, the disposition should be he is going to do it unless we can prove otherwise. He has shown through every step of the way that he’s going to win. And so it just seems to me it’s just odd that if those are the odds, if you are looking at his track record, the track record is a proven track record of success and winning. And yet, the media’s default is on every scenario, whether it’s hasn’t nominees getting through or winning a primary or him accomplishing something, it’s immediately negative and a failure.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://mediamatters.org/video/2017/01/24/trump-press-secretary-media-disposition-should-be-trump-correct-unless-we-can-prove-otherwise/215116&quot;&gt;Media Matters&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump’s disregard for the truth threatens his ability to govern.&lt;/strong&gt; In the first five days of his presidency, Trump has put the enormous power of the nation’s highest office behind spurious — and easily disproved — claims. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-disregard-for-the-truth-threatens-his-ability-to-govern/2017/01/24/945c81aa-e272-11e6-a453-19ec4b3d09ba_story.html&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump dogged by insecurity over popular vote, media coverage.&lt;/strong&gt; He might hold the most powerful office in the world, but he’s dogged by insecurity over his loss of the popular vote in the election and a persistent frustration that the legitimacy of his presidency is being challenged by Democrats and the media, aides and associates say. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://bigstory.ap.org/article/61415760238042f2ad7bc38acc2f468c/trumps-bridge-building-eclipsed-false-voter-fraud-claim&quot;&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11/ &lt;strong&gt;For Trump, everything is a rating.&lt;/strong&gt; Trump spent his first weekend in office at war with math. He said that his inauguration crowd — which photographs showed was dwarfed by Barack Obama’s estimated 1.8 million in 2009 — “looked like a million, a million and a half.” His staff members backed up that claim with what his adviser Kellyanne Conway memorably termed “alternative facts.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/arts/television/for-trump-everything-is-a-rating.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump 101: What he reads and watches.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With an allergy to computers and phones, he works the papers. With a black Sharpie in hand, he marks up the Times or other printed stories. When he wants action or response, he scrawls the staffers’ names on that paper and either hands the clip to them in person, or has a staffer create a PDF of it — with handwritten commentary — and email it to them. An amazed senior adviser recently pulled out his phone to show us a string of the emailed PDFs, all demanding response. It was like something from the early 90s. Even when he gets worked up enough to tweet, Trump told us in our interview he will often simply dictate it, and let his staff hit “send” on Twitter. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/trump-101-what-he-reads-and-watches-2210510272.html&quot;&gt;Axios&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13/ &lt;strong&gt;“We the People” demand Trump release his tax returns.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the features on the White House website that didn’t vanish when President Trump took the oath of office on Friday is the “We the People” page, which allows ordinary Americans to petition their government to address an issue of importance to them. The Obama White House, which created the feature, responded to petitions that received at least 100,000 signatures within 30 days. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/opinion/we-the-people-demand-mr-trump-release-his-tax-returns.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 4: The Upside Down.</title>
   <link href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/01/23/Day-4/"/>
   <updated>2017-01-23T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/01/23/Day-4</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;The first days inside Trump’s White House: Fury, tumult and a reboot.&lt;/strong&gt; President Trump had just returned to the White House on Saturday from his final inauguration event, a tranquil interfaith prayer service, when the flashes of anger began to build. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-first-days-inside-trumps-white-house-fury-tumult-and-a-reboot/2017/01/23/7ceef1b0-e191-11e6-ba11-63c4b4fb5a63_story.html&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;strong&gt;Spicer: ‘Negative’ Trump coverage is ‘demoralizing’&lt;/strong&gt; The White House press secretary pushed back at what he said was negative coverage of the Trump White House, describing the media narrative as “demoralizing. It’s not just about a crowd size. There’s this constant theme to undercut the enormous support he has,” Spicer said of Trump. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/315721-spicer-negative-trump-coverage-is-demoralizing&quot;&gt;The Hill&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;No White House leaks like this… until now.&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump White House not only leaks like crazy. It casually leaks the most intimate and humiliating details about the President - hurt feelings, ego injury, childlike behavior, self-destructive rages over tweets, media failure to credit his own grandiosity. We have simply never seen this level of leaking, with this little respect for the President’s dignity or reputation, this early. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/no-white-house-leaks-like-this-until-now&quot;&gt;Talking Points Memo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;Without evidence, Trump tells lawmakers 3 million to 5 million illegal ballots cost him the popular vote.&lt;/strong&gt; Days after being sworn in, President Trump insisted to congressional leaders invited to a reception at the White House that he would have won the popular vote had it not been for millions of illegal votes, according to people familiar with the meeting. Trump has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that widespread voter fraud caused him to lose the popular vote to Hillary Clinton, even while he clinched the presidency with an electoral college victory. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/01/23/at-white-house-trump-tells-congressional-leaders-3-5-million-illegal-ballots-cost-him-the-popular-vote/&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;Why Trump’s staff is lying.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the most striking features of the early Trump administration has been its political uses of lying. The big weekend story was the obviously false claim that Trump pulled in the largest inauguration crowds in American history. This raises the question of why a leader might find it advantageous to promote such lies from his subordinates. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-01-23/why-trump-s-staff-is-lying&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6/ &lt;strong&gt;The Right is building a new media “upside down” to tell Trump’s story.&lt;/strong&gt; Armed with its own set of facts, the right has created a parallel media universe that’s risen all the way with Trump to the White House. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/the-right-is-building-a-new-media-upside-down-to-tell-donald&quot;&gt;Buzzfeed&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump pays a fence mending visit to the CIA after weeks of mocking U.S. intelligence officials.&lt;/strong&gt; Trump told staffers that he’s now with them, “a thousand percent.” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2017/01/23/511165541/president-trump-pays-a-fence-mending-visit-to-the-cia&quot;&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8/ An official said &lt;strong&gt;the visit “made relations with the intelligence community worse”&lt;/strong&gt; and described the visit as “uncomfortable.” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sources-say-theres-a-sense-of-unease-in-intel-community-after-trump-cia-visit/&quot;&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump names his Inauguration Day a ‘National Day of Patriotic Devotion’.&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/01/23/trump-names-his-inauguration-day-a-national-day-of-patriotic-devotion/&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 3: Alternative facts.</title>
   <link href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/01/22/Day-3/"/>
   <updated>2017-01-22T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/01/22/Day-3</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;The Trump Administration started with a big lie over a small thing.&lt;/strong&gt; It wasn’t about an affair with an intern or in an attempt to wage war. The Trump administration kicked off with a whopper about the media’s role in maliciously minimizing the crowd size for Trump’s inauguration in a dastardly attempt to make him look bad. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/01/22/trump-administration-starts-with-big-lie-over-small-thing.html&quot;&gt;The Daily Best&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;strong&gt;Crowd scientists say Women’s March in Washington was three times the size of the audience at Trump’s inauguration&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/22/us/politics/womens-march-trump-crowd-estimates.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;), and may have been the largest demonstration in US history. Marches held in more than 500 US cities were attended by at least 3.3 million people. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vox.com/2017/1/22/14350808/womens-marches-largest-demonstration-us-history-map&quot;&gt;Vox&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;Kellyanne Conway said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the White House had put forth “alternative facts”&lt;/strong&gt; to ones reported by the news media about the size of Mr. Trump’s inauguration crowd. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/us/politics/president-trump-inauguration-crowd-white-house.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KELLYANNE CONWAY:&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t be so overly dramatic about it, Chuck. What– You’re saying it’s a falsehood. And they’re giving Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave alternative facts to that. But the point remains–&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHUCK TODD:&lt;/strong&gt; Wait a minute– Alternative facts?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KELLYANNE CONWAY:&lt;/strong&gt; –that there’s–&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHUCK TODD:&lt;/strong&gt; Alternative facts? Four of the five facts he uttered, the one thing he got right–&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KELLYANNE CONWAY:&lt;/strong&gt; –hey, Chuck, why– Hey Chuck–&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHUCK TODD:&lt;/strong&gt; –was Zeke Miller. Four of the five facts he uttered were just not true. Look, alternative facts are not facts. They’re falsehoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;Alternative facts are a needless lie by the Trump Administration.&lt;/strong&gt;
If the president and his aides will tell easily disproven falsehoods about crowd sizes and speeches, what else will they be willing to dissemble about? (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/the-pointless-needless-lies-of-the-trump-administration/514061/&quot;&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;The traditional way of reporting on a president is dead. And Trump’s press secretary killed it.&lt;/strong&gt; The presidency is not a reality show, but President Trump on his first full day in office made clear that he’s still obsessed with being what he once proudly called “a ratings machine.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-traditional-way-of-reporting-on-a-president-is-dead-and-trumps-press-secretary-killed-it/2017/01/22/75403a00-e0bf-11e6-a453-19ec4b3d09ba_story.html&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6/ &lt;strong&gt;The costs of Trump-branded reality: America’s credibility.&lt;/strong&gt; When Trump swore the presidential oath, he assumed responsibility not only for the levers of government but also for one of the United States’ most valuable assets, battered though it may be: its credibility. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/business/media/alternative-facts-trump-brand.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7/ &lt;strong&gt;Meanwhile, Trump’s top aides are troubled by his rocky first weekend in office&lt;/strong&gt;, unfolded much the way things often did during his campaign: with angry Twitter messages, a familiar obsession with slights and a series of meandering and at times untrue statements, all eventually giving way to attempts at damage control. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/us/politics/donald-trump-aides-rocky-first-weekend.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8/ &lt;strong&gt;WikiLeaks calls out Trump for refusing to release tax returns.&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/wikileaks-trump-tax-return-234000&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump is violating the Constitution by allowing his hotels and other business operations to accept payments from foreign governments&lt;/strong&gt;, a team of prominent constitutional scholars, Supreme Court litigators and former White House ethics lawyers say. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/us/politics/trump-foreign-payments-constitution-lawsuit.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 2: War on media.</title>
   <link href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/01/21/Day-2/"/>
   <updated>2017-01-21T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/01/21/Day-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;Photos comparing Trump’s inauguration crowd to the Women’s March&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/21/politics/womens-march-donald-trump-inauguration-sizes/index.html&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;strong&gt;White House press secretary Sean Spicer attacked media for accurately reporting inauguration crowds.&lt;/strong&gt; “This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period,” Spicer said, contradicting all available data. Aerial photos have indicated that former president Barack Obama’s first inauguration attracted a much larger crowd. Nielsen ratings show that Obama also had a bigger television audience. Spicer, at times almost yelling while reading a prepared statement, took no questions. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/21/media/sean-spicer-press-secretary-statement/index.html&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump used his first full day in office on Saturday to unleash a remarkably bitter attack on the news media&lt;/strong&gt;, falsely accusing journalists of both inventing a rift between him and intelligence agencies and deliberately understating the size of his inauguration crowd. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/us/politics/trump-white-house-briefing-inauguration-crowd-size.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump says he has “running war” with media, criticizes the “dishonest media,” gets facts wrong, in CIA speech.&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/21/media/donald-trump-war-with-the-media/&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5/ At CIA headquarters, Trump denies feud, lashed out at critics, boasted of his magazine covers, and &lt;strong&gt;exaggerated the size of the crowd at his inauguration.&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-cia-langley-233971&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6/ &lt;strong&gt;Trump’s real war isn’t with the media. It’s with facts.&lt;/strong&gt; He needs to delegitimize the media because he needs to delegitimize facts. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/21/14347952/trump-spicer-press-conference-crowd-size-inauguration&quot;&gt;Vox&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Day 1: How it begins.</title>
   <link href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/01/20/Day-1/"/>
   <updated>2017-01-20T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/01/20/Day-1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump has named only 29 of his 660 executive department appointments&lt;/strong&gt;, the Partnership for Public Service said. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/trump-cabinet-picks-inauguration.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ Trump boasted his inauguration would have an “unbelievable, perhaps record-setting turnout.” &lt;strong&gt;But aerial shots of the National Mall from Obama’s 2009 inauguration and today show that isn’t likely.&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/20/14332462/photos-crowd-trump-inauguration-vs-obama&quot;&gt;Vox&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;All references to climate change have been deleted&lt;/strong&gt; from the White House website. The only mention of climate on Trump’s new website is under his “America First Energy Plan” page, in which he vows to destroy Obama’s Climate Action Plan, which is a government-wide plan to reduce carbon emissions and address climate change. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://motherboard.vice.com/read/all-references-to-climate-change-have-been-deleted-from-the-white-house-website&quot;&gt;Motherboard&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;New poll shows Obamacare is more popular than Donald Trump.&lt;/strong&gt; Fox News finds that 50% of voters feel favorably about the Affordable Care Act compared to Donald Trump, whom 42% view favorably. President Obama received an approval rating of 60%. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/20/14335268/obamacare-more-popular-than-trump-poll&quot;&gt;Vox&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;There’s no record Trump has resigned from his companies.&lt;/strong&gt; To transfer control of his companies, the president has to submit filings in Florida, Delaware and New York. We spoke to officials in each of those states. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-promised-to-resign-from-his-companies-but-no-record-hes-done-so&quot;&gt;ProPublica&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
