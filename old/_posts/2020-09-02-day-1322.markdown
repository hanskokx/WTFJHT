1/ **The CDC directed states to prepare to distribute a coronavirus vaccine to health care workers and high-risk groups as soon as late October or early November**, heightening concerns that the Trump administration is seeking to rush a vaccine before Election Day. Public health officials in all states and territories, as well as New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Houston, and San Antonio, were sent CDC guidance outlining scenarios for distributing two vaccine candidates ‚Äî each requiring two doses a few weeks apart ‚Äî at hospitals, mobile clinics, and other facilities. And, in a letter to state governors and health departments last week, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield asked state governors to waive permits for building vaccine distribution sites "that would prevent these facilities from becoming fully operational by November 1, 2020." Dr. Anthony Fauci and FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn have both recently said that a vaccine could be available before clinical trials have been completed. "I believe that by the time we get to the end of this calendar year," Fauci said, "we will feel comfortable that we do have a safe and effective vaccine." Hahn [added](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/08/31/day-1320/#3-fda-commissioner-stephen-hahn-said) that an emergency authorization for a vaccine could be appropriate even before the vaccine has completed Phase 3 clinical trials.

2/ **The Trump administration backed out of a $646.7 million deal to buy ventilators after a congressional investigation found ‚Äúevidence of fraud, waste and abuse‚Äù** in the acquisition, which negotiated by White House trade advisor Peter Navarro. The House Committee on Oversight and Reform‚Äôs Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy has since opened a probe of all federal contracts negotiated by Navarro. ([ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-trump-administration-is-backing-out-of-a-647-million-ventilator-deal-after-propublica-investigated-the-price) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/09/02/navarro-pandemic-coronavirus/) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/31/coronavirus-house-panel-opens-probe-of-white-house-trade-advisor-navarro-after-cancellation-of-ventilator-contract.html))

* **Congressional investigators uncovered more than $1 billion dollars in potential waste and fraud in the Paycheck Protection Program.** The money went to companies that "double dipped" and received multiple in violation of the program's rules, according to a preliminary analysis by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis. The report says there is a "high risk that PPP loans may have been diverted from small businesses truly in need to ineligible businesses or even to criminals." The subcommittee found more than 10,000 loans in which the borrowers obtained more than one loan. Because the Trump administration decided to only audit loans for more than $2 million, only 65 of the loans would otherwise have been subject to additional review. More than 600 loans totaling nearly $100 million went to companies that are barred or suspended from doing business with the federal government. More than 350 loans worth roughly $200 million went to government contractors that had been flagged by the federal government for performance or integrity issues. More than 11,000 additional borrowers had other red flags of various types. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/congressional-investigation-finds-over-1-billion-ppp-fraud-n1239001) / [Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-coronavirus-ppp-small-business-loan-fraud-20200901-7d5o2sh2qrbi3l42vrmtdjqg6q-story.html))

3/ **FEMA will no longer reimburse states for the cost of face masks and personal protective equipment in nonemergency settings.** Under the new guidance, which goes into effect on Sept. 15., cloth face coverings and PPE for teachers, schools, public housing, and courthouses will no longer be eligible for the public assistance fund because they don't meet FEMA's definition of a "direct emergency protective measures." The Department of Health and Human Services, however, said "schools in need will still receive cloth face masks" from HHS instead of FEMA. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/09/01/908413181/fema-says-it-will-stop-paying-for-cloth-face-masks-for-schools))

4/ **The Department of Homeland Security withheld an intelligence bulletin warning of a Russian campaign to spread misinformation about Joe Biden's mental health**. In the draft July bulletin, titled ‚ÄúRussia Likely to Denigrate Health of US Candidates to Influence 2020 Election,‚Äù analysts said with "high confidence" that "Russian malign influence actors are likely to continue denigrating presidential candidates through allegations of poor mental or physical health to influence the outcome of the 2020 election." An hour after its submission, however, DHS Chief of Staff John Gountanis intervened, saying ‚ÄúPlease hold on sending this one out until you have a chance to speak to \[acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf\]." The Biden campaign, meanwhile, accused Trump of blocking the release of the report, saying the Russian narrative "aligns with Trump's own constantly backfiring attacks" that Biden is not mentally competent to be president. "And why would he do this?" a spokesperson for the Biden campaign said, "Because Russia and the Trump campaign are speaking from the same script of smears and lies.‚Äù Nearly two months later, the bulletin has not been circulated to local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies.

5/ **Melania Trump "regularly" used a private email account while in the White House.** Stephanie Winston Wolkoff said she corresponded multiple times per day with Melania through a private Trump Organization email account, iMessage, and Signal, an encrypted messaging app. Trump made the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's private emails and server a major part of his 2016 campaign, calling it ‚Äúworse than Watergate.‚Äù ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/melania-trump-used-private-email-accounts-while-in-the-white-house-says-former-colleague-and-friend/2020/09/01/3f678ae2-eb3c-11ea-99a1-71343d03bc29_story.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/54d09be4086a084ff13ed11561871581) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/washpost-melania-trump-private-email-accounts-white-house-dc91842e-8b1f-47fa-9447-a08cb46e44f1.html))

***Editor's note**: Friendly reminder that polls should be thought of as directional evidence of a prevailing feeling. They're inherently flawed, biased, and should never be used for prediction. Like the weather report, polls are a point-in-time temperature check. We've all been caught out in the rain on sunny day, right?*

The president‚Äôs opponent in the 2020 campaign, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., was being controlled by 'people that you‚Äôve never heard of, people that are in the dark shadows.' Police officers like the one in Kenosha, Wis., who shot an unarmed Black man seven times last week ‚Äî leaving him paralyzed from the waist down ‚Äî have a hard time with pressure and so 'they choke, just like in a golf tournament, they miss a three-foot.'"
