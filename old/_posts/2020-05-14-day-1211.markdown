1/ **Another 2.98 million people filed unemployment claims last week, bringing the two-month total to 36.5 million**. While the weekly count of new claims has been declining since late March, it was the eighth-straight week of numbers in the millions. Continuing claims is now at around 22.8 million. A survey by the Federal Reserve found that in households making less than $40,000 a year, nearly 40% of those who were working in February lost their jobs in March or the beginning of April. The jobless rate has more than tripled to 14.7% from 4.4% a month earlier. Trump, meanwhile, said he doesn‚Äôt see the U.S. unemployment rate dropping below 10% until September.

* **üìå [Day 1162](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/03/26/day-1162/#1-a-record-3-28-million-americans-fi): A record 3.28 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week ‚Äì¬†the largest number of unemployment claims ever recorded for a single week since the government began collecting data in 1967**. The number shatters the Great Recession peak of 665,000 claims in March 2009 and the all-time mark of 695,000 in October 1982. As a result, the U.S. unemployment rate has likely already risen to 5.5% from 3.5% in February ‚Äì a level not seen since 2015. A similarly large number of initial unemployment claims is expected next week when the Labor Department releases its report on claims filed this week. In the prior Labor Department report, for the week ended March 14, initial claims totaled 282,000.

* **üìå [Day 1169](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/04/02/day-1169/#1-more-than-6-6-million-americans-ap): More than 6.6 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week ‚Äì double the 3.3 million who applied the previous week**. About 6% of the U.S. work force filed for jobless benefits in the last two weeks. In March, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs, erasing nearly all the jobs created in the past five years. Economists say the real number of people out work is probably higher and that as many as 20 million people could be out of work this summer. The Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, updated its economic projections and expects U.S. unemployment to exceed 10% in the second quarter ‚Äì eclipsing the peak of the last recession ‚Äì and gross domestic product to fall by more than 7%, or an annualized 28%.

Economists estimate that the U.S. unemployment rate is now 13% ‚Äì¬†the worst level of joblessness the nation has seen since the Great Depression. In February, the unemployment rate was 3.5%. The number of jobs lost in the last three weeks now exceeds the 15 million that it took 18 months during the Great Recession, from 2007 to 2009.

In the past four weeks, more than 22 million Americans have filed for unemployment aid ‚Äî wiping out nearly all the job gains since the Great Recession. The U.S. unemployment rate is now over 20% and is expected remain close to 10% through the end of the year.

More than 4.4 million people filed for unemployment last week ‚Äì down from more than 5.2 million the week before ‚Äì which marks the fifth straight week that job losses were measured in the millions. Roughly 22 million jobs were created after the 2008 financial crisis.

* **The White House threatened to veto a $3 trillion pandemic relief bill**.

Dr. Fauci told a Senate committee Tuesday that his "concern" is that we'll see "see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks" if cities and states "prematurely open up without having the capability of being able to respond effectively and efficiently." Dr. Fauci also told the panel that a vaccine for the coronavirus would not be ready in time for the new school year, warning of the dangers of the virus to children. Trump, however, told reporters he was "surprised by his answer,‚Äù adding: ‚ÄúTo me it‚Äôs not an acceptable answer, especially when it comes to schools.‚Äù Past public disagreements between Trump and officials have been followed by an eventual dismissal or resignation.

The consequences could be really serious \[...\] there is no doubt that when you pull back on mitigation, you will see some cases reappear.‚Äù Dr. Fauci added that the death toll is "almost certainly" higher than official counts. He also dismissed the notion that a vaccine would be available by the time schools reopen in the fall, calling it "a bit of a bridge too far." He added: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no guarantee that the vaccine is actually going to be effective.‚Äù Dr. Fauci, Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the CDC, and Stephen Hahn, the head of the FDA, all testified by videoconference because they are self-quarantining after possible exposure to COVID-19.

Richard Burr stepped down as chairman of the Intelligence Committee following an FBI investigation into whether he sold stocks after secret briefings on the threat of the coronavirus pandemic**, which led to the seizure of his cellphone by federal agents. Burr has denied he did anything wrong and previously asked the Ethics Committee to review the stock sales. Burr sat on two committees that received briefings on the growing coronavirus epidemic, including one on Jan. 24. On Feb. 13, Burr sold as much as $1.7 million in stock. The decision to execute a search warrant on a sitting member of Congress, which was approved at the highest levels of the Justice Department, requires federal prosecutors and agents to persuade a judge there is probable cause to believe a crime has been committed.
