1/ **Dr. Anthony Fauci warned a Senate committee that the U.S. is "not in total control" of the coronavirus and that infections could more than double to 100,000 a day if the country fails to contain the surge**. The nation‚Äôs top infectious diseases expert said "we're going in the wrong direction‚Äù and the recent sharp rise in cases, largely in the South and the West, ‚Äúputs the entire country at risk." Fauci declined to estimate the number of potential deaths, but said ‚ÄúIt is going to be very disturbing, I guarantee you that.‚Äù

2/ **The White House and the National Security Council learned that Russia was offering bounties on U.S. and coalition troops in early 2019** ‚Äì at least a month before an April 2019 car bomb attack in Afghanistan that killed three U.S. Marines. The intelligence was also included in at least one of Trump‚Äôs President‚Äôs Daily Brief documents at the time, according to U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the intelligence. John Bolton, Trump‚Äôs national security adviser at the time, reportedly told colleagues he briefed Trump on the intelligence in March 2019.

3/ **Trump received a second written presidential daily briefing earlier this year that Russia paid bounties for the killing of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan**. The intelligence was included months ago in Trump‚Äôs President‚Äôs Daily Brief in late February. One official cited the Feb. 27 briefing document. Trump doesn't fully or regularly read the President's Daily Brief, preferring to receive an oral briefing two or three times a week by his intelligence officials. While the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, confirmed that "The president does read," she claimed that Trump was not briefed about the bounties in an oral session, saying ‚ÄúHe was not personally briefed on the matter. That is all I can share with you today.‚Äù McEnany also condemned the New York Times for publishing "unverified" allegations, suggesting that "rogue intelligence officers" were undermining Trump and national security.
