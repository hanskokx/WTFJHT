1/ **Trump refused to commit to a "peaceful transfer of power" if he loses the election, saying ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have to see what happens.‚Äù** Trump ‚Äì apparently referring to mail-in ballots, which he has repeatedly attacked as widely fraudulent, despite providing no evidence to support his claims ‚Äì¬†continued: "The ballots are a disaster. Get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very peaceful ‚Äî there won't be a transfer, frankly. There'll be a continuation." On Wednesday, Trump said he wanted to [quickly confirm](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/09/23/day-1343/#1-trump-predicted-that-the-election) a replacement for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg because he expects the Supreme Court to decide the result of the election, which could split 4-to-4 if a ninth justice is not seated. And in June, Trump [declined](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/07/20/day-1278/#5-trump-declined-to-say-whether-he-w) to commit to accepting the results of the election if he lost, saying he would "have to see," before claiming that mail-in voting would "rig the election." Biden's campaign, meanwhile, said "The American people will decide this election and the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House."

2/ **Congressional Republicans dismissed Trump's comments, but failed to directly criticize his remarks**. Many Republicans, including Mitch McConnell, promised that there would be a peaceful transfer of power if Biden won, but didn't explain what they'd do if Trump resisted leaving office.  "The President says crazy stuff. We've always had a peaceful transition of power. It's not going to change," Sen. Ben Sasse said. Mitch McConnell, meanwhile, promised an "orderly transition." Meanwhile, during a Fox News Radio interview, Trump said he would abide by a Supreme Court decision if the election results were contested, but before leaving the White House for North Carolina, Trump said he wasn't sure the election could be ‚Äúhonest‚Äù because mail-in ballots are ‚Äúa whole big scam.‚Äù

* **Postmaster General Louis DeJoy told a judge the U.S. Postal Service can‚Äôt reassemble the high speed mail-sorting machines that were taken apart this year**.

"The Postal Service will do it's job to deliver the ballots. When the President goes into that the Postal Service doesn't -- is not equipped to do it, which, he is incorrect with that," DeJoy said.

4/ **Trump suggested that the White House would overrule the FDA if the agency issued new, tougher standards for the emergency authorization of a coronavirus vaccine.** Trump questioned why the FDA would set a higher standard for granting emergency authorization for a vaccine, saying it ‚Äúsounds like a political move.‚Äù The FDA is [expected](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/09/22/day-1342/#3-the-fda-is-expected-to-announce-a) to soon announce new standards for an emergency authorization, which are meant to increase public trust and transparency in the vaccine process. FDA commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn, meanwhile, promised the Senate Health Committee that the "FDA will not authorize or approve any COVID-19 vaccine before it has met the agency's rigorous expectations for safety and effectiveness." He also said that the FDA "will not permit any pressure from anyone to change that." Trump, however, said any new FDA guidance "has to be approved by the White House. We may or may not approve it."
