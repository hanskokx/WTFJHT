1/ **Trump said he was "looking forward" to speaking with Robert Mueller's team of prosecutors under oath** as they investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, as well as possible obstruction of justice. "I would love to do it, and I would like to do it as soon as possible," Trump said. "I would do it under oath, absolutely." He is expected to talk to Mueller's team in two or three weeks.

2/ **Michael Flynn didn't tell the White House about his 2017 interview with the FBI**.

3/ **Robert Mueller's team has interviewed Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, National Security Agency director Mike Rogers, and CIA director Mike Pompeo**.

4/ **Trump asked the acting director of the FBI how he voted in the 2016 election** shortly after he fired James Comey in May 2017. Andrew McCabe said he didn't vote. Trump then "vented his anger at McCabe over the several hundred thousand dollars in donations that his wife, a Democrat, received for her failed 2015 Virginia state Senate bid from a political action committee controlled by a close friend of Hillary Clinton."

5/ **Steve Bannon will meet with Robert Mueller by the end of the month, where he'll be asked about the firings of Michael Flynn and James Comey**.

6/ **Sarah Sanders: Trump hasn't fired Robert Mueller partly because of how the press would react**.

([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/23/politics/robert-mueller-donald-trump-fire-white-house/index.html))

7/ **Former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates added an attorney to his legal team.** The move to hire Tom Green suggests there is an ongoing negotiation between Gates and Robert Mueller's office.
