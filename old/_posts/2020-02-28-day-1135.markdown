1/ **A federal appeals court blocked Trump's ‚ÄúRemain in Mexico‚Äù immigration policy**, which required people applying for asylum at the border to wait in Mexico while their claims for protection were reviewed. The court ruled that the policy ‚Äúis invalid in its entirety due to its inconsistency with‚Äù federal law, and ‚Äúshould be enjoined in its entirety.‚Äù Some 59,000 people have been sent back to Mexico since January 2019. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals also issued a separate ruling that upheld a lower court's block on an administration policy denying asylum to those who crossed the southern border illegally.

2/ **Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney suggested that Americans ignore the media‚Äôs coverage of the coronavirus** while acknowledging that the outbreak will likely cause disruptions to everyday life in the U.S., such as school closures and changes to public transportation. Mulvaney claimed that the media ignored the administration‚Äôs early efforts, because it was preoccupied with thinking impeachment ‚Äúwould bring down the president." Mulvaney then suggested that the news media only switched to the coronavirus because ‚Äúthey think this is going to be what brings down‚Äù Trump. He then urged Americans to ‚ÄúTurn off your televisions for 24 hours."

* **A worldwide threats assessment in 2018 and 2017 warned about the increasing risks of a global pandemic** that could strain resources and damage the global economy. Intelligence analysts even mentioned a close cousin of the COVID-19 strain of coronavirus by name, saying it had "pandemic potential" if it were "to acquire efficient human-to-human responsibility." The 2019 worldwide threat assessment reported "that the United States and the world will remain vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or large-scale outbreak of a contagious disease that could lead to massive rates of death and disability, severely affect the world economy, strain international resources, and increase calls on the United States for support."

3/ **The Trump administration is considering a tax cut package as part of the White House‚Äôs economic response to the coronavirus outbreak after all three major U.S. stock indexes suffered their worst weekly decline since the 2008 financial crisis**. For the week, all three indexes fell more than 10%, and since Feb. 19, U.S. stocks have lost nearly $3.6 trillion in value. Trump‚Äôs top economic advisor Larry Kudlow [suggested](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/28/trump-aide-kudlow-urges-calm-on-coronavirus-stocks-look-pretty-cheap.html) that investors shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúrule out more optimistic options," saying ‚ÄúStocks looks pretty cheap to me.‚Äù Trump, meanwhile, leaned on the Federal Reserve for help, saying he hopes "the Fed gets involved, and I hope they get involved soon." Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the central bank would ‚Äúact as appropriate‚Äù to help the U.S. economy.

7/ **Trump announced that he would nominate Rep. John Ratcliffe as his permanent director of national intelligence**. In 2019, Trump attempted to make the lawmaker his spy chief, but backed off after the nomination was met with resistance in Congress, where lawmakers raised questions about Ratcliffe's credentials and whether he padded his resume. Nevertheless, Trump tweeted today that he was nominating Ratcliffe, calling him ‚Äúan outstanding man of great talent!‚Äù ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-says-he-will-nominate-john-ratcliffe-be-intel-chief-n1145621) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/28/politics/john-ratcliffe-dni-nominate/index.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/28/us/politics/john-ratcliffe-director-national-intelligence.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-again-plans-to-nominate-john-ratcliffe-as-intelligence-director/2020/02/28/163661fe-5a7b-11ea-8753-73d96000faae_story.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-to-nominate-texas-rep-john-ratcliffe-as-director-of-national-intelligence-11582929162))
