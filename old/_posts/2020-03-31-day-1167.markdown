1/ **More than 2,000 people could die *every day* from COVID-19 in the U.S. in April** and 224,000 hospital beds ‚Äì 61,000 more than the U.S. has ‚Äì will be needed around April 15, when the U.S. is estimated to reach "peak resource use," according to news [projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections) cited by Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator. Assuming social distancing continues through May, the model finds that, by August, around 82,000 people in the U.S. could die from COVID-19. Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Birx estimated that ‚Äúour real number" of total coronavirus deaths is between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans ‚Äì lower than the 2.2 millions estimated deaths that would occur if no distancing or mitigating measures were taken. Fauci added: "As sobering as that number is, we should be prepared for it." Trump, meanwhile, warned of ‚Äúa very, very painful two weeks‚Äù ahead. Trump's decision to extend social distancing guidelines until April 30 came after officials reviewed 12 different statistical models that all "ended up at the same numbers."
