1/ **Trump ‚Äì again ‚Äì downplayed the severity of the coronavirus epidemic, saying "everything is working out" and that "it will go away, just stay calm."** There have been more than 800 cases of coronavirus in the U.S., including 27 deaths. And, despite markets showing continued volatility following Wall Street's worst day since the 2008 financial crisis, Trump suggested that ‚ÄúThe consumer has never been in a better position than they are right now.‚Äù ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/10/markets-economy-coronavirus-live-updates/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/business/stock-market-today.html))

* **Trump invited a group of Wall Street executives to the White House to discuss the response to COVID-19 after stock market losses.** The seven biggest banks in the U.S. were invited, and at least two of them plan to send their CEO to attend the meeting on Wednesday.

2/ **Trump pitched Republican lawmakers on a 0% payroll tax rate that would last through the November election** as the White House tries to put together an economic stimulus plan to counteract the impact from the coronavirus outbreak. Speaking to reporters afterwards, Trump called the meeting ‚Äúgreat‚Äù and said there was ‚Äútremendous unity‚Äù despite the meeting ending without a plan for crafting an economic package. Republican and Democratic senators also expressed reluctance about a payroll tax cut to address the economic impact. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, is working on an economic stimulus package to ensure workers have access to free coronavirus tests and paid sick leave. Payroll taxes are paid by employers and employees to fund Social Security, Medicare, and other government programs.

3/ **The Trump administration postponed an annual intelligence report ‚Äì without explanation ‚Äì that warns that the U.S. remains unprepared for a global pandemic**. The office of the Director of National Intelligence was scheduled to deliver the Worldwide Threat Assessment to the House Intelligence Committee on Feb. 12. The hearing, however, has not been rescheduled. Two officials who have read the classified report, said that the warnings are similar to those published in the 2019 report, which states: ‚ÄúThe United States will remain vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or large-scale outbreak of a contagious disease that could lead to massive rates of death and disability, severely affect the world economy, strain international resources, and increase calls on the United States for support.‚Äù ([Time](https://time.com/5799765/intelligence-report-pandemic-dangers/))

Intelligence analysts even mentioned a close cousin of the COVID-19 strain of coronavirus by name, saying it had ‚Äúpandemic potential‚Äù if it were ‚Äúto acquire efficient human-to-human responsibility.‚Äù The 2019 worldwide threat assessment reported ‚Äúthat the United States and the world will remain vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or large-scale outbreak of a contagious disease that could lead to massive rates of death and disability, severely affect the world economy, strain international resources, and increase calls on the United States for support.‚Äù ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/u-s-intel-agencies-warned-rising-risk-outbreak-coronavirus-n1144891))

Mark Meadows is the fifth Republican lawmaker to self-quarantine himself over fears coronavirus exposure. Sen. Ted Cruz and Reps. Paul Gosar, Doug Collins and Matt Gaetz have also quarantined themselves for 14 days out of caution. Meadows, Cruz, Collins, and Gaetz all interacted with Trump on the day they were exposed. Trump, meanwhile, hasn't been tested for coronavirus, saying "I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal \[...\] I feel extremely good."

5/ **The Trump administration ordered immigration courts to remove all coronavirus posters from courtrooms and waiting areas**. After the Miami Herald published news about an Executive Office for Immigration Review email that directed all judges and staff members to remove the posters, a Department of Justice spokesman said that the ‚Äúthe signs shouldn‚Äôt have been removed. It‚Äôs now being rectified.‚Äù The official, however, declined to discuss why the email directive was sent in the first place. ([Miami Herald](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article241046076.html))

* **The CDC director contradicted Trump's claim that his border wall will contain the coronavirus**. Trump tweeted that his wall is "Going up fast \[...\] We need the Wall more than ever!"

* **Trump administration officials discussed shutting down travel from Italy and South Korea as the coronavirus outbreak worsened**. Ultimately, officials decided that the virus was spreading too quickly to be contained and it would be hard to justify the diplomatic, logistical, and economic consequences. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/white-house-debated-halting-travel-from-south-korea-italy-amid-coronavirus-06d07781-c008-418a-b404-89d3a1274882.html))

The Justice Department must now give lawmakers access to all the report‚Äôs blacked-out words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, and pages, as well as underlying interviews and memos cited in Mueller‚Äôs probe. The lawsuit was filed before the start of the impeachment inquiry, but House lawyers told the court that lawmakers are still trying to determine whether Trump lied in his written responses to questions from Mueller‚Äôs investigators. The ruling can be appealed to the full court or to the Supreme Court.

The materials must be disclosed by Wednesday.

The House Judiciary Committee is seeking grand jury testimony from the redacted version of Mueller‚Äôs report into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
