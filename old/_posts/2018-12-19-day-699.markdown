1/ **Newly obtained document show Trump signed a letter of intent to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, contradicting Rudy Giuliani's claim that the document was never signed**. The signed letter is dated Oct. 28, 2015. Trump Jr. [testified](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/05/16/day-482/#trump-jr-testified-that-his-father-s) on Sept. 7, 2017 that his father had signed a letter of intent for the Moscow project, which Michael Cohen worked on, but he knew "very little" about it. Cohen also told congressional committees investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election that Trump had signed the letter. On Sunday, Giuliani claimed: "It was a real estate project. There was a letter of intent to go forward, but no one signed it." During the 2016 campaign, Trump did not disclose that the Trump Organization explored the business deal with Russia. Instead, he repeatedly claimed he had "nothing to do with Russia." [Read](http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2018/images/12/18/attachment.1.pdf) the signed letter of intent.

* **ðŸ“Œ[Day 680](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/11/30/day-680/#1-trump-jr-s-testimony-to-the-senate): Trump Jr.'s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee conflicts with Michael Cohen's version of events regarding negotiations of a prospective Trump Tower in Moscow**. In Cohen's version, he says the discussions with at least one Russian government official continued through June 2016. Trump Jr. testified in September 2017 that talks surrounding a Trump Tower in Moscow concluded without result "at the end" of 2014 and "certainly not \[20\]16. There was never a definitive end to it. It just died of deal fatigue." Trump Jr. told the Senate committee that he "wasn't involved," knew "very little," and was only "peripherally aware" of the deal other than a letter of intent was signed by Trump. He also said he didn't know that Cohen had sent an email to Putin's aide, Dmitry Peskov. In Cohen's [guilty plea](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/11/29/day-679/#1-michael-cohen-pleaded-guilty-to-ma), he said he briefed Trump's family members about the continued negotiations.

2/ **Giuliani conceded that "of course" Trump signed the "bullshit" letter of intent to build a Trump Tower in Moscow**. "I don't think I said nobody signed it," Giuliani claimed, despite telling CNN on Sunday that "no one signed" the letter. The deal would have given Trump's company $4 million upfront, plus a percentage on all sales, as well as marketing and design oversight. The hotel would have also named the spa after Ivanka Trump. ([New York Daily News](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-news-trump-tower-russia-letter-intent-20181219-story.html))

3/ **Mitch McConnell introduced a stopgap spending bill to keep the government running into February**, which does not include the money Trump wants for his border wall. Both chambers are expected to pass the measure by Friday's midnight deadline, and avoid a partial shutdown. The White House has not publicly confirmed Trump will sign the measure. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/19/mcconnell-to-introduce-short-term-funding-bill-to-avert-shutdown-1068976) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/19/senate-short-term-bill-avoid-government-shutdown) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-signals-it-might-accept-a-short-term-spending-bill-to-avert-shutdown/2018/12/19/63148a02-0395-11e9-9122-82e98f91ee6f_story.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/19/politics/government-shutdown-congress-trump-border-wall/index.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/us/politics/government-shutdown-threat.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/mcconnell-announces-stopgap-funding-measure-would-avert-shutdown-n949821))

4/ **Trump ordered a "full" and "rapid" withdrawal of all 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria within 30 days**, according to a U.S. defense official. Pentagon officials tried to talk Trump out of the decision, arguing that the move would betray Kurdish allies who have fought alongside American troops in Syria, but "the president said 'Everybody out,'" a senior administration official said. In announcing the decision, Trump tweeted: "We have defeated ISIS in Syria." However, in August the Pentagon estimated that there were still as many as 14,500 ISIS fighters still in Syria.
