1/ **The Trump administration plans to use a fast-track deportation process to bypass immigration judges in order to quickly deport undocumented immigrants** who have illegally entered the U.S. within the past two years. Previously, the policy for "expedited removal" had been limited to migrants caught within 100 miles of the U.S. border who had been in the country for less than two weeks. The Department of Homeland Security defended the shift, saying the new plan will ease the backlogged immigration courts by allowing ICE to deport unauthorized immigrants without placing them in "timeconsuming removal proceedings." Expedited removals will take effect immediately. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/trump-administration-to-expand-its-power-to-deport-undocumented-immigrants/2019/07/22/76d09bc4-ac8e-11e9-bc5c-e73b603e7f38_story.html) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-gets-expanded-power-to-swiftly-deport-more-undocumented-immigrants/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/us/politics/trump-immigration-deportations.html))

* **Trump wants to meet with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer "ASAP" to discuss conditions at the U.S.-Mexico border** after Schumer took a tour of migrant detention facilities and called them "inhumane."

2/ **House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said there is "very substantial evidence" in Robert Mueller's report that Trump is "guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors."** House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff added that it was "clear" that the Justice Department feels bound by an Office of Legal Counsel opinion that prevents indicting a sitting president, alleging that Trump "is an essentially unindicted co-conspirator." The House Judiciary Committee would be in charge of leading impeachment proceedings if the House decided to move forward with articles of impeachment. Mueller is scheduled to testify on July 24th in front of both the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees in back-to-back public hearings, where he will answer questions about the contents of his report and his 22-month-long investigation.

3/ **Trump doesn't think Mueller should be allowed to testify before Congress about his ties to Russia and possible obstruction of justice**. Trump tweeted that "Mueller should not be given another bite at the apple," because "in the end it will be bad for him." Trump also complained that the "phony Democrats" in Congress "have done nothing but waste time on this ridiculous Witch Hunt," and again called for investigations into Hillary Clinton instead of himself and his campaign.

4/ **Mueller will offer his entire 448-page report as his official statement when he testifies** Wednesday before the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees. Justice Department officials have reportedly told Mueller that the department expects him to limit his congressional testimony to the public findings in his report, arguing that anything outside the report is covered by "presidential privilege" that hasn't been waived. Mueller will have a brief opening statement, which hasn't been seen by the Justice Department.

5/ **Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee have paid more than $600,000 in legal fees to the law firm that represents Hope Hicks**. The House Judiciary Committee is reexamining the truthfulness of Hicks's mid-June testimony after unsealed court documents revealed that she was in close contact with Michael Cohen as he was negotiating a hush money payment with Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet about an alleged affair with Trump. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/19/politics/donald-trump-hope-hicks-legal-fees/))

* **ðŸ“Œ [Day 911](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2019/07/19/day-911/#3-the-house-judiciary-committee-aske): The House Judiciary Committee asked Hope Hicks to clarify her congressional testimony after newly unsealed documents showed "apparent inconsistencies."** The documents reveal that Hicks spoke on the phone with Trump and Michael Cohen about Stormy Daniels and the Trump campaign's attempt to stop Daniels from going public with the allegations about an affair with Trump. Hicks originally stated that she "had no knowledge of Stormy Daniels other than to say she was going to be mentioned in the story." Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said the new documents "raises substantial questions about the accuracy" of Hicks' original statements.

6/ **A federal judge blocked congressional subpoenas for Trump Organization financial records in a lawsuit over whether Trump is violating the emoluments clause of the Constitution**. Democrats sent 37 subpoenas earlier this month seeking financial information about Mar-a-Lago, the Trump International Hotel, Trump Tower and other Trump properties. The subpoenas had a due date of July 29th. Judge Emmet Sullivan made the decision after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said it should hear the case.

On average, the companies founded by immigrants also employed 11% more people than the Fortune 500 companies with non-immigrant founders.
