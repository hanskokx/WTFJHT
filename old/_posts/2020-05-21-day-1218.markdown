1/ **Another 2.4 million workers filed new unemployment claims last week**. Since efforts to the contain coronavirus pandemic nine weeks ago, more than 38.6 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits, leading to levels of unemployment not seen since the Great Depression. An analysis of the coronavirus pandemic's effects on the labor market estimates that 42% of recent layoffs will result in permanent job loss. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/21/unemployment-claims-numbers-coronavirus-272868) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/21/unemployment-claims-coronavirus/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-claims.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/self-employed-arent-counted-in-wave-of-unemployment-claims-11590053402?mod=hp_lead_pos2) /[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-21/another-2-4-million-americans-filed-for-unemployment-last-week?sref=MIBMEEoj))

* **The White House‚Äôs top economic official expressed uncertainty that America‚Äôs economy would quickly rebound** from the downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic despite Trump‚Äôs confidence.

* **üìå [Day 1162](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/03/26/day-1162/#1-a-record-3-28-million-americans-fi): A record 3.28 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week ‚Äì¬†the largest number of unemployment claims ever recorded for a single week since the government began collecting data in 1967**. The number shatters the Great Recession peak of 665,000 claims in March 2009 and the all-time mark of 695,000 in October 1982. As a result, the U.S. unemployment rate has likely already risen to 5.5% from 3.5% in February ‚Äì a level not seen since 2015. A similarly large number of initial unemployment claims is expected next week when the Labor Department releases its report on claims filed this week. In the prior Labor Department report, for the week ended March 14, initial claims totaled 282,000.

About 6% of the U.S. work force filed for jobless benefits in the last two weeks. In March, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs, erasing nearly all the jobs created in the past five years. Economists say the real number of people out work is probably higher and that as many as 20 million people could be out of work this summer. The Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, updated its economic projections and expects U.S. unemployment to exceed 10% in the second quarter ‚Äì eclipsing the peak of the last recession ‚Äì and gross domestic product to fall by more than 7%, or an annualized 28%.

Economists estimate that the U.S. unemployment rate is now 13% ‚Äì¬†the worst level of joblessness the nation has seen since the Great Depression. In February, the unemployment rate was 3.5%.

6/ **The Trump administration will withdraw from another international major arms control treaty**. The Open Skies treaty allows 35 nations, including Russia, to conduct unarmed reconnaissance flights over each other‚Äôs territory in order to assure that nations are not preparing for military action. The Trump administration argued that Russia has been violating the agreement by blocking the U.S. from flying surveillance missions.
