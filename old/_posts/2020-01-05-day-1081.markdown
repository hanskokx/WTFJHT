1/ **Trump authorized a drone strike at Baghdad International Airport that killed Iran's top security and intelligence commander late Thursday**. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the Pentagon had taken "decisive defensive action" and killed Qasem Soleimani, who led the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, because he "was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region." Soleimani was the architect of nearly every significant operation by Iranian intelligence and military forces over the past two decades.Esper also accused Soleimani of approving the attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad earlier this week. Speaking to reporters while on vacation at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday – hours after the attack on the American Embassy in Baghdad – Trump insisted that he did not want war, saying "I want to have peace. I like peace."

2/ **Trump claimed he ordered the killing of Soleimani "to stop a war" – not start one – and that Soleimani's "reign of terror is over."** In brief remarks from Mar-a-Lago, Trump said Soleimani had been caught "in the act" planning "imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel." Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, meanwhile, argued that the drone strike was a necessary act of self defense.

3/ **Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vowed "severe revenge" and "harsh retaliation" in response to the U.S. drone strike that killed Soleimani**. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called the killing a "heinous crime" and said his country would "take revenge." Trump, meanwhile, warned that he was "prepared to take whatever action is necessary" if Iran threatened Americans, despite insisting that he took action to avoid a war with Iran. Trump also defended killing the Iranian general, tweeting he "should have been taken out" years ago and that "Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!"

4/ **Trump threatened – twice – to target Iranian cultural sites if Iran retaliated**. Trump tweeted a day earlier that the U.S. was prepared to strike 52 Iranian assets, including some "at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture." Two senior U.S. officials, meanwhile, described widespread opposition within the administration to targeting cultural sites in Iran. "They're allowed to kill our people. They're allowed to torture and maim our people. They're allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people," Trump said. "And we're not allowed to touch their cultural site? It doesn't work that way." Destroying cultural sites could be considered a war crime under international agreements, such as the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.

5/ **Trump ordered the strike killing Soleimani without the consultation of Congress**. The Trump administration still hasn't explained the legal justification for the strike, prompting Democrats and some Republican lawmakers to question whether Trump had the authority to order the strike without Congressional approval. Trump, meanwhile, claimed that his tweets are sufficient notice to Congress of any possible U.S. military strike on Iran. Also at question is whether the Trump administration has international legal authority for the strikes. The U.S. is in Iraq with consent from the Iraqi government, but the attack was outside the scope of the U.S. mandate.

6/ **The Iraqi parliament passed a resolution calling on the Iraqi government to expel U.S. troops from Iraq** following the U.S drone attack that killed Soleimani. Iraq's Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi told lawmakers that the U.S. drone attack was a "political assassination" and that it was "time for American troops to leave" "for the sake of our national sovereignty." About 5,000 American troops are in Iraq. The Trump administration tried to persuade Iraqi officials to stop the parliamentary vote to force the U.S. military out of Iraq. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, meanwhile, dismissed calls by Mahdi for a timetable for all foreign troops to exit the country.
