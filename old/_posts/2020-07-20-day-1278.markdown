1/ **The Trump administration is trying to block funding for coronavirus testing and contact tracing, the CDC and the National Institutes of Health in the upcoming coronavirus relief package**. The Senate Republican proposal would allocate $25 billion to states for conducting testing and contact tracing, about $10 billion for the CDC, and about $15 billion for the National Institutes of Health. The proposal would also provide $5.5 billion to the State Department and $20 billion to the Pentagon. White House officials, however, is seeking to zero out the funding in the upcoming bill and push states to take responsibility for testing. Trump has also repeatedly questioned the value of widespread testing, arguing that if there were fewer tests conducted, the number of infections would be lower.

* **The director of the CDC said the pandemic could be brought under control over the next four to eight weeks if ‚Äúwe could get everybody to wear a mask right now.‚Äù** Researchers have found that wearing a basic cloth face covering is more effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19 than wearing nothing at all. Meanwhile, in a Fox News interview that aired Sunday, Trump said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt agree with the statement that if everybody wear a mask everything disappears.‚Äù On Monday, however, Trump tweeted that face masks are "Patriotic" after months of refusing to wear a face covering in public.

* **State and local officials warn that they lack key resources to confront a surge in coronavirus cases**.

* **A South Korea study found that children between the ages of 10 and 19 can spread the coronavirus at least as well as adults do**. Children under 10 were roughly half as likely as adults to spread the virus to others. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/health/coronavirus-children-schools.html))

2/ **The next coronavirus relief bill is expected to tie school funding to classrooms reopening** and will likely include a payroll tax cut. The GOP plan is expected to include around $70 billion for elementary and secondary schools. About 10% will be set aside for nonpublic schools. Trump previously suggested he would not sign a new relief bill unless a payroll tax cut is included and the administration is also trying structure a payroll tax cut as a deferral rather than a straight cut.

3/ **Trump insisted that he'll "be right eventually" about the coronavirus pandemic, repeating his claim that "it's going to disappear."** In a Fox News Sunday interview, Trump downplayed the danger of the coronavirus, saying that the rising number of U.S. deaths ‚Äúis what it is,‚Äù claimed that many cases are just people who "have the sniffles" and that many of those cases are "young people that would heal in a day," and called Dr. Anthony Fauci "a little bit of an alarmist." The U.S. death toll, meanwhile, passed crossed 140,000. Trump also insisted that the U.S. has "the best mortality rate" in the world, which is not true.

4/ **Trump will resume the White House coronavirus task force briefings on Tuesday**. Trump held near-daily news conferences for several weeks before abandoning the practice after an April session during which he [speculated](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/04/24/day-1191/#2-health-officials-the-makers-of-lys) that disinfectants, such as bleach, or sunlight could be injected ‚Äúinside the body" to fight the coronavirus. Sunday marked the 41st straight day that the seven-day average for new daily coronavirus infections in the U.S. trended upward.

5/ **Trump declined to say whether he would accept the results of the election if he lost.** When asked by Fox News' Chris Wallace whether he was a "good loser," Trump replied: "I'm not a good loser. I don't like to lose." Trump then said he thinks that mail-in voting is going to "rig the election." Wallace then asked, "Are you suggesting that you might not accept the results of the election?" Trump responded: "I have to see. I'm not just going to say yes. I'm not going to say no." Trump then claimed that Hillary Clinton is "the one who never accepted the loss."

### Notables.

1. **The White House portraits of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush were removed from a prominent space in the Grand Foyer to a small, rarely used room that is not seen by most visitors**.

You see, that's all misrepresentation."
