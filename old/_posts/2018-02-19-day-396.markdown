1/ **March For Our Lives: Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School are calling for a March 24 march on Washington** and a national student walkout to demand action on gun control and challenge the politicians that have failed to protect them. A shooting at the Parkland, FL, high school on Feb. 14 left 17 dead. The March 24 march is to bring attention to school safety, ask lawmakers to enact gun control, and "demand that their lives and safety become a priority and that we end this epidemic of mass school shootings." They're encouraging students from around the country to join the protest.

2/ **Former Trump aide Rick Gates will plead guilty to fraud-related charges and has agreed to testify against Paul Manafort.** Gates, currently facing roughly 18 months in prison, could see "a substantial reduction in his sentence'' if he cooperates with Mueller's investigation. ([Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-rick-gates-plea-deal-20180218-story.html))

3/ **Several conservatives want Trump to issue presidential pardons as a way of limiting Robert Mueller's investigation**. Larry Klayman, a conservative legal activist, said: "I think he should pardon everybody" ‚Äì Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, Michael Flynn, George Papadopoulos ‚Äì¬†"and pardon himself."

4/ **The new White House security clearances policy puts a "bull's eye" on Jared Kushner**, according to an official. John Kelly announced Friday that the White House will no longer allow some employees with interim security clearances access to top-secret information. Abbe Lowell, one of Kushner's lawyers, said Kelly's directive "will not affect Mr. Kushner's ability to continue to do the very important work he has been assigned by the president." Kushner requests more information from the intelligence community than any White House employee.

5/ **Robert Mueller's interest in Jared Kushner has expanded beyond his contacts with Russia** and now includes his efforts to secure financing for his company from foreign investors during the presidential transition. Mueller's investigators have been asking about Kushner's conversations during the transition to finance a Kushner Companies-backed New York City office building facing financial troubles.

6/ **Trump blamed everybody but Russia as he lashed out against the Russia investigation in a nine-hour, profanity-laced, and error-laden tweetstorm**. He attacked the FBI, CNN, the Democratic Party, his national security adviser, former president Obama, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Hillary Clinton, and more. He never criticized Russia or Putin's attempts to undermine U.S. elections.

7/ **National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster said the "evidence is now incontrovertible" that Russia meddled in the U.S. political system**, essentially telling the Munich Security Conference to ignore Trump's tweet. Trump countered on Twitter, naturally: "General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems."

8/ **Trump suggested that the FBI could have stopped the school shooter at a Florida high school if they spent less time on the Russia investigation**. "Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!" Trump tweeted.
