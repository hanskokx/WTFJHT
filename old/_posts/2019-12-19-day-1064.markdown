1/ **House Speaker Nancy Pelosi won't commit to sending the articles of impeachment against Trump to the Senate until she sees "the process that is set forth" to ensure a "fair" trial**. Democrats have questioned the impartiality of the Senate trial after Mitch McConnell said he's coordinating with the White House to quickly acquit Trump. Senior Democratic aides suggested it was "very unlikely" that the House will send the articles to the Senate before January, effectively delaying the impeachment trial well into the new year, in order to pressure Republicans to allow new witnesses and evidence in the proceeding. "We cannot name managers until we see what the process is on the Senate side," Pelosi said. "So far we haven't seen anything that looks fair to us."

2/ **Mitch McConnell mocked Pelosi's threat to withhold the articles of impeachment, criticizing her as "too afraid"** to transmit "their shoddy work product." McConnell then called the impeachment inquiry "the most rushed, least thorough, and most unfair" in modern history.

* **Putin said Trump was impeached on "trumped-up charges" for reasons "far-fetched" and doesn't believe the Senate will "vote him out of power."** Putin also likened Trump's impeachment to the probe into collusion with Russia, which Putin played down as groundless.

The timing means that Pompeo will not have to meet, be seen or photographed with Taylor. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/19/politics/pompeo-taylor-ukraine/index.html))

8/ **Trump implied that the late Rep. John Dingell is "looking up" from hell while also mocking his widow, Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell**. At a rally in Michigan, Trump said he gave John an "A-plus" funeral and that Debbie, whom he called "a real beauty," called to thank him, saying "John would be so thrilled. He's looking down. He'd be so thrilled." Trump then told the crowd: "Maybe he's looking up, I don't know. I don't know. Maybe. But let's assume he's looking down." Dingell was the longest-serving member of Congress in U.S. history.
