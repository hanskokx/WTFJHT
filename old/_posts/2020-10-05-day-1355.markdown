1/ **At a news conference at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Saturday, doctors provided few medical details, but on Sunday doctors disclosed that Trump's condition was more serious than the White House had acknowledged**. On Saturday, White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said Trump was ‚Äúdoing very well,‚Äù that his fever had subsided, his symptoms were improving, and that he wasn‚Äôt receiving supplemental oxygen. Trump reportedly told doctors, "I feel like I could walk out of here today."

2/ **Minutes after Saturday's news conference, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told reporters that Trump's "vitals over the last 24 hours were very concerning and the next 48 hours will be critical,"** adding that ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still not on a clear path to a full recovery.‚Äù Meadows‚Äôs remarks were attributed to "a person familiar with the president‚Äôs health" in a pool report sent to White House journalists, but video shows Meadows approaching pool reporters outside Walter Reed following the briefing and asking to speak off the record, making clear who the unnamed source was. Trump was reportedly "furious" with Meadows after he offered a more dire assessment and contradicted Dr. Conley's assessment.

3/ **On Sunday, Dr. Conley said Trump's "oxygen saturation was transiently dipping below 94%" ‚Äì a level that can indicate that a patient's lungs are compromised ‚Äì and that Trump had been prescribed dexamethasone**, a steroid used to head off an immune system overreaction that kills many COVID-19 patients. The National Institutes of Health and World Health Organization both recommend dexamethasone for patients on supplemental oxygen or ventilators. Doctors also repeatedly ignored questions about the results of Trump's CT scans and advanced imaging, only saying they had seen ‚Äúexpected findings.‚Äù

4/ **Dr. Conley attempted to address the contradictory statements that had come from him and Meadows on Saturday, telling reporters ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction**. In doing so, it came off that we were trying to hide something, which wasn‚Äôt necessarily true.‚Äù Conley also said his comments were meant to reflect the ‚Äúupbeat attitude‚Äù of the White House. White House communications director Alyssa Farah, meanwhile, said Dr. Conley withheld details about Trump's medical condition in order to "convey confidence" and "raise the spirits" of the president.

* **Thursday**: Hicks tested positive; Trump left the White House for a fundraiser with hundreds of supporters at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J.; Trump tested positive from a rapid test at some point Thursday; Trump confirmed on Sean Hannity's show on Fox News that Hicks had tested positive; hours later Trump and Melania Trump announced that they had tested positive following the results from a PCR test.

* **Friday**: Trump had a fever and his oxygen saturation levels dipped below 94%, White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said; Trump was given supplemental oxygen for about an hour at the White House; Trump was later taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and was administered an 8-gram dose of an experimental polyclonal antibody cocktail and his first dose of remdesivir.

* **Saturday**: Trump's blood oxygen level dropped for a second time to about 93% and was given the steroid dexamethasone; Trump was given a second dose of remdesivir; White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Trump‚Äôs vital signs were ‚Äúvery concerning‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still not on a clear path to a full recovery"; Dr. Conley said Trump was 72 hours into the diagnosis 36 hours after Trump said he received a positive result (70 hours from Saturday would have meant a diagnosis on Wednesday); Trump tweeted a video that he was ‚Äústarting to feel good.‚Äù

* **Sunday**: Trump's blood oxygen level improved to 98%; doctors suggested that Trump might be discharged Monday; Trump left the hospital to go for a drive-by in a black SUV with the windows rolled up and two Secret Service agents inside.

5/ **Trump unexpectedly left Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Sunday for a motorcade drive-by to wave to supporters**. Video showed Trump wearing a mask and waving from behind the closed window of a black SUV, accompanied by at least two Secret Service agents, who were wearing respirators and eye protection. Prior to the drive-by, Trump reportedly told advisers that he was bored in the hospital. Dr. James Phillips, chief of disaster medicine at George Washington University Hospital and an attending physician at Walter Reed called the stunt "insanity," tweeting that the "Presidential SUV is not only bulletproof, but hermetically sealed against chemical attack. The risk of COVID19 transmission inside is as high as it gets outside of medical procedures. The irresponsibility is astounding.‚Äù Multiple Secret Service agents criticized Trump‚Äôs drive-by, accusing Trump of putting his protective detail in unnecessary danger. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not even pretending to care now,‚Äù an agent who requested anonymity said. "That should never have happened," another unidentified agent said. The drive-by also violated CDC guidelines, which call on health care professionals to "limit transport and movement of the patient outside of the room to medically essential purposes." In a video posted on Twitter around the same time, Trump said he‚Äôs ‚Äúlearned a lot‚Äù about the coronavirus while undergoing treatment. ‚ÄúThis is the real school.  This isn‚Äôt the let‚Äôs-read-the-book school. And I get it. And I understand it.‚Äù ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-covid-19-walter-reed-wave/2020/10/04/12dbe38c-064f-11eb-a166-dc429b380d10_story.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-04/trump-aide-says-president-is-eager-to-campaign-defends-rallies?sref=MIBMEEoj) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/trump-walter-reed-supporters-ddef32c8-b77f-4dcd-a822-0b1b7cb10987.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-criticized-medical-experts-after-leaving-hospital-drive-supporters-n1242081) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/04/trump-hospital-drive-criticism/) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/519588-secret-service-agents-criticize-trump-car-ride-this-should-never-have) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-donald-trump-international-news-politics-ap-top-news-cac560ef169f9e5343d98a128573194a) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/04/trump-makes-surprise-appearance-outside-hospital-426127) / [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-10-04/trump-receiving-powerful-lung-drug-doctors-disclose-revealing-more-serious-symptoms) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/04/trump-walter-reed-drive-by-visit-criticism))

Don't let it dominate your life."** Trump also announced that he will be leaving Walter Reed medical center at 6:30 p.m. ET today after receiving treatment that included experimental treatments unavailable to most Americans. The virus has killed more than 211,000 Americans so far. Trump argued with his doctors after they told him to go to Walter Reed on Friday. Doctors reportedly gave Trump an ultimatum: he could go to the hospital while he could still walk, or doctors would take him in a wheelchair or on a stretcher if his health deteriorated. Trump waited to leave for the hospital until the stock market closed on Friday. Trump‚Äôs advisers, meanwhile, urged Trump not to check out of the hospital as recently as this morning, saying ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt wanna come back.‚Äù ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/05/meadows-trump-hospital-monday-426394) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/05/politics/donald-trump-covid-condition-walter-reed/index.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-he-s-leaving-hospital-monday-evening-n1242172) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/05/world/covid-trump) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2020/10/05/trump-biden-live-updates/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/03/politics/trump-covid-response/) / [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/10/this-is-spiraling-out-of-control-allies-panic-about-trumps-hospital-stay-as-white-house-deflects) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-covid-19-updates-monday/h_93b46e07a41c65f3020320270644f3c7))

The new guidance now says the "CDC continues to believe, based on current science, that people are more likely to become infected the longer and closer they are to a person with COVID-19" and that the the virus can ‚Äúsometimes be spread by airborne transmission‚Äù and can be spread by both droplets and aerosols released when people ‚Äúcough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe.‚Äù ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/05/health/cdc-coronavirus-airborne-indoor-air.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/05/health/cdc-covid-19-airborne-transmission-guidance/index.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/10/05/cdc-coronavirus-airborne-transmission/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/05/cdc-coronavirus-airborne-warning-426490) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/live-updates/coronavirus/?id=73425358&cid=clicksource_4380645_7_three_posts_card_hed))
