1/ **Another 1 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week**, and an another 608,000 workers applied for aid through the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program. In total, 27 million workers are unemployed and more than 14.5 million are collecting benefits ‚Äì up from 1.7 million a year ago. The report also marks the 22nd time in 23 weeks that new jobless claims have come in above 1 million. Before the coronavirus pandemic, initial claims had never topped 700,000 in a week. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/27/economy/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus/index.html) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/27/weekly-jobless-claims.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/383eb8856eda415ed3a3b17894be035f) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/27/unemployment-claims-fell-slightly-403465) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/business/economy/unemployment-claims.html))

2/ **The CDC attempted to clarify its recommendation that people with no symptoms ‚Äúdo not necessarily need a test‚Äù ‚Äì even after exposure to the coronavirus**. In a new statement, the CDC's director, Dr. Robert Redfield, said that ‚Äútesting may be considered for all close contacts of confirmed or probable COVID-19 patients.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúEveryone who needs a COVID-19 test, can get a test. Everyone who wants a test does not necessarily need a test." The CDC's previous guidance recommended that people exposed to the coronavirus be tested because of the threat of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission. Despite Redfield's statement, the CDC's website had not been updated.

* **The Trump administration will purchase 150 million rapid coronavirus tests for about $750 million**, which will be deployed in nursing homes, schools and other areas with populations at high risk. Abbott Laboratories received an emergency authorization from the FDA on Wednesday for the test, which costs $5 and can produce results in 15 minutes without the use of any lab equipment. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-abbott/trump-administration-to-purchase-150-million-abbott-covid-19-tests-for-750-million-idUSKBN25N2NA) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/27/trump-rapid-coronavirus-tests-403602))

3/ **Trump ‚Äì without evidence ‚Äì claimed that problems with mail-in ballots on Election Day will come from election officials who are "going to count them wrong."** Multiple investigations and studies ‚Äì including Trump's own voter fraud investigatory committee ‚Äì have found no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the U.S. Trump, however, said he's not worried about USPS's ability to deliver ballots ‚Äì "it has nothing to do with the post office" ‚Äì but rather ‚ÄúThe problem is when they dump all these \[ballots\] in front of a few people who are counting them, and they're going to count them wrong." Trump added that the "only thing" he's worried about is "unsolicited ballots, where they're going to send 80 million unsolicited ballots to people that they don't even know if they're alive or if they're living there." Earlier this month, Trump threatened to veto any coronavirus relief package that included funding for the USPS, and baselessly suggested that election drop boxes would lead to widespread fraud.

4/ **Trump dismissed the NBA player-led protest of the police shooting of Jacob Blake hours after Jared Kushner said the players were ‚Äúvery fortunate‚Äù to be ‚Äúable to take a night off from work.‚Äù** Trump told reporters that while he doesn't "know much" about the protest, ‚ÄúI know their ratings have been very bad because I think people are a little tired of the NBA \[...\] They‚Äôve become like a political organization, and that‚Äôs not a good thing.‚Äù Pence's chief of staff, Marc Short, meanwhile, called the protests "absurd and silly," adding "If they want to protest, I don't think we care." The comments from the White House come a day after the NBA postponed three scheduled playoff games, prompted by the Milwaukee Bucks' demanding that lawmakers address police brutality and racial injustice. The unprecedented decision to postpone games was followed by players and teams from the WNBA, MLB, NFL, MLS, and pro tennis sitting out events Wednesday night. Trump has made restoring "law and order" a centerpiece of his campaign following the death of George Floyd, a Black man Minneapolis police killed in late May, which spurred national protests.

5/ **Biden accused Trump of "rooting for more violence, not less" because he thinks it benefits him politically**. Biden also suggested that Trump is making the situation worse by "pouring gasoline on the racial flames that are burning \[...\] the people have a right to be angry, people have a right to protest." He continued: "This is the same guy, when people came out of Charlottesville and a young woman gets killed, they're spewing hate, and their veins bulging, carrying swastikas \[...\] he says there are very fine people on both sides. He just keeps pouring fuel on the fire. He's encouraging this." Biden concluded: "This is his America."

* **Kamala Harris, meanwhile, accused Trump and Republicans of ignoring "the reality" of the "life of a Black person in America."** In a speech to prebut Trump's appearance at RNC, Harris said Trump's ‚Äúreckless disregard for the well-being of the American people" has been deadly. As ‚ÄúDonald Trump stood idly by \[...\] Instead of rising to meet the most difficult moment of his presidency, Donald Trump froze. He was scared and he was petty and vindictive.‚Äù ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/27/politics/kamala-harris-speech/index.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/27/harris-attacks-trumps-incompetence-coronavirus-response-in-acceptance-speech-prebuttal-403770) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/kamala-harris-rnc-rebuttal-c9391e5c-2cda-47ad-b350-e3908cee092d.html))

* **The RNC aired a video meant to give viewers "a taste of Biden's America," but the video included footage from Barcelona, Spain.** Other images of protests in the segment included a march in Brooklyn, a car on fire in Chicago, and drone footage of a tree on fire in New York.

6/ **Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman filed a complaint with the Pentagon's inspector general suggesting he and his brother Alexander was retaliated against for disclosing potential ethics violations by senior White House officials.** Alexander Vindman served as a key witness during Trump's impeachment and was dismissed from his position on the National Security Council in February. Yevgeny Vindman worked as a deputy legal adviser for the NSC and a senior ethics official on the NSC staff. He was also removed after the impeachment proceedings ended. Yevgeny Vindman's legal team said in a statement that actions were "improperly taken against him in retaliation for his protected disclosures involving matters that ultimately led to the president's impeachment as well as disclosures of misconduct by other current senior members of the president's national security team."

7/ **The Trump Organization has charged taxpayers more than $900,000 in fees related to Trump‚Äôs 271 visits to his own properties since he took office**. At least $570,000 came as a result of Trump's travel. Campaign finance records also show that the Trump Organization received at least $3.8 million in fees related to 37 instances in which Trump headlined a political event at one of his properties.

* **The White House said that it has compiled a "very large" dossier on a Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post reporter and others**, calling them a "disgrace to journalism and the American people." In a statement, White House spokesperson Judd Deere accused The Washington Post of "blatantly interfering with the business relationships of the Trump Organization" and demanded "it must stop."
