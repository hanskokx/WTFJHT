1/ **"At this moment," Trump won't sign the Senate-passed funding measure that would avoid a partial government shutdown if it doesn't include his border wall money**, Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. Paul Ryan added that Trump has "concerns for border security." Trump previously told Democrats he would be "proud" to shut down the government if they refused to give him $5 billion for his border wall. Democrats held firm and GOP leaders were forced to instead pursue a short-term spending bill that would avoid a shutdown, which the Senate unanimously passed Wednesday night to fund federal agencies through February 8th. The Senate-passed bill does not include funding for Trump's wall. Hours after the Senate passed its bill, House Republicans revolted over concerns that they were punting the border wall fight to next year, when Democrats take control of the House. Trump's opposition dramatically increases the chances of a government shutdown starting Friday night.

* **A Florida man started a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to pay for Trump's border wall**. The campaign has raised over $5.5 million in the three days since it started, with an overall goal of $1 billion. Brian Kolfage believes that if the 63 million Americans who voted for Trump donated $80 each, they would be able to raise the $5 billion Trump is asking Congress for.

* **Fox & Friends called Trump's defeat on border wall funding "a stunning turn of events."** ([Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-and-friends-stunned-by-trumps-loss-to-pelosi-on-wall))

2/ **Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker declined to recuse himself from the Russia investigation** despite a Justice Department ethics official advising him to step aside out of an "abundance of caution." The ethics official said that while a recusal was "a close call," there was no actual legal conflict of interest that would require Whitaker to recuse himself. Members of Congress are concerned about Whitaker's previous criticism of Robert Mueller's investigation. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/20/politics/matthew-whitaker-attorney-general-robert-mueller-investigation/index.html) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/ap-source-whitaker-recuse-russia-probe-59931040) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/20/matthew-whitaker-recusal-russia-investigation-1071488))

3/ **Trump's pick for attorney general criticized Mueller's obstruction of justice investigation in an unsolicited memo he sent to the Justice Department in June**. William Barr said "Mueller's obstruction theory is fatally misconceived," claiming that Trump's interactions with James Comey would not constitute obstruction of justice, because Trump was using his "complete authority to start or stop a law enforcement proceeding." If confirmed as attorney general, Barr would oversee Mueller's work. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-attorney-general-pick-criticized-an-aspect-of-mueller-probe-in-memo-to-justice-department-11545275973) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/us/politics/barr-whitaker-mueller-trump.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/19/politics/bill-barr-comey-obstruction/index.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/20/william-barr-trump-attorney-general-muller-investigation-memo) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/attorney-general-nominee-wrote-memo-criticizing-mueller-obstruction-probe/2018/12/20/72a01304-044b-11e9-b5df-5d3874f1ac36_story.html))

* **Rod Rosenstein: Barr's "memo had no impact on our investigation."** The deputy attorney general added that the memo "reflects Mr. Barr's personal opinion," and that "lots of people offer opinions" but they "don't influence our own decision making." ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/20/rosenstein-barr-memo-mueller-probe-1071029))

4/ **The House Intelligence Committee voted to send the transcript of its 2017 interview with Roger Stone to Mueller**, suggesting that the special counsel is close to charging Stone with a crime. It's the first time Mueller has formally asked the committee to hand over material gathered related to the Russia investigation. Stone's relationship with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and whether he played a role in the release of stolen DNC emails has been a focus of the special counsel's investigation for months.

5/ **Trump's 2016 campaign and his 2020 reelection campaign used a shell company to buy ads in alleged illegal coordination with the NRA**. FCC records show that the Trump campaign's ad disclosures include signatures and names of individuals working for National Media, despite no mention of National Media, or it's known affiliates Red Eagle Media Group and American Media & Advocacy Group, on any FCC or Federal Election Commission disclosures. The ad buyers' names are also included in ad documents for the NRA and America First, but with the buyers' affiliation listed as National Media or one of its affiliates. Rebuilding America Now, a super PAC supporting Trump, was also named in a recent Mueller court filing regarding a $125,000 wire transfer to Paul Manafort â€” a payment Manafort lied to federal investigators about.

* **ðŸ“Œ [Day 686](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/12/06/day-686/#4-trump-and-the-nra-used-the-same-co): Trump and the NRA used the same consultants to execute complimentary TV advertising strategies during the 2016 presidential election**. The NRA used a media strategy firm called Red Eagle Media, while the Trump campaign purchased ads through a firm called American Media & Advocacy Group, which were aimed at the same demographic as the NRA spots. Both firms are affiliated with the conservative media-consulting firm National Media Research, Planning and Placement, with both the NRA's and the Trump campaign's ad buys were also authorized by the same person at National Media. The arrangement is likely a violation of campaign finance laws. ([Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/12/nra-trump-2016-campaign-coordination-political-advertising/))

* **Treasury Department officials exchanged messages using unsecured Gmail accounts set up by their Russian counterparts during the 2016 election**. *\[Editor's note: I don't even know where to begin with summarizing this, but it's important.

([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/20/trump-administration-food-stamps-snap-regulations) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-directs-usda-expand-work-requirements-food-stamps/story?id=59913434) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-administration-aims-to-toughen-work-requirements-for-food-stamps-recipients/2018/12/20/cf687136-03e6-11e9-b6a9-0aa5c2fcc9e4_story.html))

5. **Putin praised Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria, calling it "correct."** Trump, meanwhile, defended his surprise decision, despite mounting criticism from lawmakers in both parties, saying the U.S. doesn't "want to be the Policeman of the Middle East." ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-policeman-middle-east-trump-defends-syria-withdrawal/story?id=59927100) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/20/trump-defends-syria-withdrawal-1070943) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/world/europe/putin-trump-syria.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-calls-withdrawing-us-troops-from-syria-no-surprise-amid-mounting-backlash/2018/12/20/d26fdcd6-0452-11e9-b6a9-0aa5c2fcc9e4_story.html))
