1/ **Despite public health experts repeatedly cautioning that developing an effective coronavirus vaccine will take at least a year to a year and a half, Trump claimed that the coronavirus will ‚Äúgo away at some point" and declared ‚Äì¬†without evidence ‚Äì that a vaccine would be ready "by the end of the year, maybe before."** Trump named a two-man team to lead his administration‚Äôs effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine, saying Operation Warp Speed is currently evaluating 14 vaccine candidate. Trump urged state governments to reopen their economies regardless of whether the timeline was met, suggesting that the lack of a vaccine would not prevent the U.S. from reopening. "I just want to make something clear. It's very important: Vaccine or no vaccine, we're back," Trump said. "We're starting the process." Operation Warp Speed consists of Moncef Slaoui, the former head of pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline's vaccines division, and Gen. Gustave Perna, a four-star U.S. Army general. Slaoui called Trump's goal of a vaccine by January 2021 a ‚Äúcredible objective,‚Äù but acknowledged that ‚ÄúFrankly, 12-18 months is already a very aggressive timeline. I don‚Äôt think Dr. Fauci was wrong.‚Äù ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/15/politics/trump-vaccine-effort-coronavirus/index.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/15/trump-coronavirus-vaccine-development-team-260678) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/trump-downplays-need-for-coronavirus-vaccine-itll-go-away-at-some-point.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-names-scientist-army-general-lead-coronavirus-vaccine-effort-n1207906) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine-timeline.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage))

2/ **The CDC issued six, one-page checklists of recommendations to guide schools, businesses, restaurants and bars, child care centers and mass transit systems on how to safely reopen during the coronavirus pandemic**. The White House coronavirus task force originally asked the CDC to revise a more extensive set of guidelines ‚Äì which was about 57 pages ‚Äì that the agency had prepared more than a month ago, calling it "overly prescriptive."

* **Mitch McConnell admitted that he was wrong to claim that the Obama administration had not left behind a plan to deal with a pandemic in the U.S.** The concession comes days after he falsely accused the Obama administration of failing to leave the Trump administration "any kind of game plan" for something like the coronavirus pandemic.

Meanwhile, Trump praised the coronavirus rapid test used to screen White House staff and visitors, calling it "a great test," despite a study finding that it may miss up to half of infections detected by other tests on the market.([The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/497846-trump-says-testing-may-be-frankly-overrated) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/15/trump-praises-coronavirus-test-despite-fda-warning-260759))

* **The ACLU sued Betsy DeVos over new federal guidelines on how campus handle sexual assault allegations**, alleging that the Title IX changes would "inflict significant harm" on victims, make it "more difficult for victims of sexual harassment or sexual assault to continue their educations" and "dramatically undermine" their civil rights.
