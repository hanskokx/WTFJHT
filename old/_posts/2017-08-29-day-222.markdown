1/ **Robert Mueller is investigating whether Trump tried to conceal the purpose of Trump Jr.'s meeting with the Russian lawyer**. Prosecutors want to know what Trump's role was in crafting Trump Jr.'s response to reports about the meeting. The White House initially said Trump only ["weighed in"](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/01/day-194/#2-the-white-house-said-trump-only-we) on Trump Jr.'s statement about the Russia meeting. It was later reported that Trump [personally dictated](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/01/day-194/#1-trump-personally-dictated-trump-jr) Trump Jr.'s statement about the meeting.

2/ **Trump Jr. agreed to testify privately before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the “next few weeks.”** The panel had invited him to attend a July hearing to testify in public, but he declined. It's unclear if he will eventually testify publicly.

3/ **Michael Cohen said he didn’t inform Trump that he had sent the email to Putin’s top press official asking for “assistance”** in arranging a licensing deal for a Trump Tower in Moscow. The Trump Organization attorney [sent the email in January 2016](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/28/day-221/#4-trumps-attorney-sent-an-email-to-p) to Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s top press aide, at the recommendation of Felix Sater, a Russian-American businessman who was serving as a broker on the deal. Cohen said he never heard back from Peskov and the project never got off the ground.

4/ **Mueller issued subpoenas for Paul Manafort's current spokesman and his former lawyer seeking documents and testimony**. The subpoenas are among dozens that the Mueller investigative team has sent out in recent months since taking over the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Manafort is under investigation for possible tax and financial crimes. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/29/politics/mueller-manafort-attorney-spokesman-subpoenas/index.html))

5/ **Trump warned North Korea that "all options are on the table" after it fired a missile over Japan**. The recent ballistic missile test "has signaled its contempt" for the international community, Trump said in a statement. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley added that “something serious has to happen.” ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/29/trump-shinzo-abe-phone-call-north-korea-242123) / [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/28/politics/north-korea-launch-unidentified-projectile/index.html))

6/ **Trump fired the organizer for his Phoenix speech because he was upset about the crowd size and TV coverage**. After his speech, Trump had his top security aide inform longtime aide George Gigicos that he’d never manage a Trump rally again. Gigicos has organized all of Trump’s main campaign events and occasional rallies since entering office and is one of the four longest-serving aides to the president. Gigicos joins Sean Spicer, Reince Priebus, Stephen Bannon, Sebastian Gorka, and Anthony Scaramucci, who have all resigned or been fired.

7/ **Trump praised the crowd size while touring Corpus Christi in the aftermath Tropical Storm Harvey**. "What a crowd, what a turnout," Trump said to several hundred people surrounding a fire station where he spoke from a ladder between fire trucks. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/348424-trump-praises-turnout-outside-fire-station-where-he-was-briefed-on-harvey))

8/ **Trump tweeted that he intentionally understaffed FEMA** in order to shrink the federal government. His tweet came in response to a critical Fox and Friends segment where Laura Ingraham said the damage and flooding in Texas from Hurricane Harvey is proof that the Trump administration needs to be fully staffed. Of the 591 key positions that require Senate confirmation, just 117 have been filled. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/29/trump-shrink-government-laura-ingraham-242128))
