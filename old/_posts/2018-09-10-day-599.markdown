1/ **The Trump campaign team was "fully aware" of George Papadopoulos' efforts to set up a Trump-Putin meeting**.

"The campaign was fully aware what I was doing" and Trump was "open to this idea," but deferred to Jeff Sessions, who was "quite enthusiastic."

2/ **Trump is expected to declassify documents about the government's surveillance of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page** and the investigative actions taken by Justice Department lawyer Bruce Ohr.

3/ **Trump won't enforce the $130,000 hush-money nondisclosure agreement between Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen**, claiming he has "never taken the position that he was a party" to the NDA because he never signed the agreement.

* **Michael Cohen agreed to tear up the nondisclosure agreement barring Stormy Daniels from discussing her alleged affair with Trump and requested that she pay back the $130,000 she received**. Michael Avenatti, who represents Daniels, called it a "legal stunt" in order to avoid Trump being deposed in the case.

* **Stormy Daniels said she "vigorously opposes" Trump and Cohen's offer to not enforce her nondisclosure agreement**, claiming their "sudden desire to escape" the agreement is a signal that they have been "shamelessly deceiving this Court and the American public for more than six months."

4/ **The Trump administration discussed plans for a coup in Venezuela last year** with rebels who were rebuffed by the Obama administration.

The U.S. eventually decided not to help the rebels, and the coup plans stalled. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/world/americas/donald-trump-venezuela-military-coup.html))

5/ **Jeff Sessions defended the Trump administration's "zero tolerance" immigration policy as "perfectly legitimate, moral and decent."** He also argued that in order to deter a large number of migrants, the U.S. need to adopt a tougher stance on immigration, saying: "The world will know what our rules are, and great numbers will no longer undertake a dangerous journey." Sessions plans to increase the number of immigration judges by 50% by the end of the year.
