1/ **The top Ukraine expert at the National Security Council testified that "there was no doubt" that Trump was seeking investigations into political rivals**, according to a transcript of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman's deposition. Within an hour after Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky, Vindman told White House lawyers that Trump had made a "troubling and disturbing" request for an investigation. Vindman also testified that "there was no ambiguity" that Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, told him the idea of tethering a White House meeting to the Ukrainians investigating the Bidens "had been coordinated with White House Chief of Staff Mr. Mick Mulvaney."

2/ **Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney refused to comply with a subpoena**. Mulvaney informed investigators "one minute" before his scheduled deposition that he would not appear, citing "absolute immunity."

Mulvaney is the highest-ranking White House official to be subpoenaed for testimony as part of the impeachment inquiry.

Fiona Hill, who served until July as the White House's top expert on Russia and Europe, also told lawmakers that she was "shocked" when she read the transcript of Trump's call with Zelensky. Hill also testified that then national security adviser John Bolton "repeatedly" told staff "that nobody should be talking to Rudolph W. Giuliani, on our team or anybody else should be." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry-live-updates/2019/11/08/2b1e67dc-01b2-11ea-8501-2a7123a38c58_story.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/08/fiona-hill-impeachment-testimony-released-067908) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/08/politics/transcripts-released-fiona-hill-alexander-vindman/index.html))

* **John Bolton reportedly knows about "many relevant meetings and conversations" regarding the Trump administration's campaign against Ukraine**. The former national security adviser didn't appear for his deposition scheduled on Thursday, because he and his former deputy, Charles Kupperman, are asking for a court ruling on competing demands by the executive branch and the legislative branch. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/us/politics/john-bolton-ukraine.html))

5/ **Republicans intend to subpoena the whistleblower to testify in the House's impeachment investigation**. Democrats, however, have rejected the idea citing safety concerns. They also hold veto power over any GOP subpoena requests for witness testimony. The whistleblower's attorney, meanwhile, issued a cease and desist letter to the White House due to Trump's "rhetoric and activity that places" the whistleblower "in physical danger." Trump has repeatedly attacked the credibility of the whistleblower, demanded to "meet his accuser," and called for the identity of the whistleblower to be revealed publicly. ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/469384-jordan-republicans-to-subpoena-whistleblower-to-testify-in-public-hearing) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/07/politics/ukraine-whistleblower-trump-cease-and-desist/index.html))

([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/07/visit-arlington-cemetery-reminded-donald-trump-jr-all-his-familys-sacrifices-he-writes/))

6/ **House Democrats established three parameters for their public impeachment hearings**, which begin next week. Investigators will follow "three interrelated lines of inquiry" to determine if Trump asked a foreign leader to initiate investigations to benefit his personal political interests, used the power of the Office of the President to apply pressure on Ukraine, and whether the Trump administration tried to conceal information from Congress about Trump's actions and conduct. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/07/house-republicans-want-whistleblower-testify-public-impeachment-hearings-067292))

7/ **Trump is "not concerned" about the impeachment inquiry**. He called it a "hoax" because "I never even heard of these people. I have no idea who they are." ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment-idUSKBN1XI19R))
