1/ **The Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration's request to skip the appeals court process and review a district court judge's ruling requiring the administration to resume renewals of protected status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program**. In September, Trump announced that he would shut down DACA on March 5, but two federal judges ordered the administration to allow people to renew their protected status while legal challenges move forward. DACA shields some 700,000 young, undocumented immigrants from deportation.

2/ **Trump's refusal to drop his demand that Mexico pay for a border wall derailed a planned White House visit by President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto**. A contentious phone call between the two presidents led to an impasse over the promised border wall, which Mexico considers offensive and has no intention of paying for.

3/ **The House Intelligence Committee released a redacted version of the Democratic memo rebutting the memo written by Devin Nunes**, which claimed the FBI and Justice Department were biased against the Trump campaign and abused their power. Trump blocked the release of the latest memo two weeks ago. It was released after undergoing a review by top law enforcement officials and redactions. The White House dismissed the Democratic memo as an attempt "to undercut the president politically."

5/ **Trump claimed he would have run into the Florida high school during the shooting without a gun to stop the gunman**. "I really believe I'd run in there even if I didn't have a weapon," Trump told a group of governors at the White House. He added: "Don't worry about the NRA. They're on our side."

6/ **Ivanka Trump thinks it's "inappropriate" to ask her about her father's sexual misconduct** because she has a "right as a daughter to believe my father." In the same interview, Trump also said her father's proposal to arm teachers is "an idea that needs to be discussed." She added: "I think that having a teacher who is armed who cares deeply about her students or his students and who is capable and qualified to bear arms is not a bad idea."
