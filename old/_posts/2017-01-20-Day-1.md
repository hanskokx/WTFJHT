1/ **Donald Trump has named only 29 of his 660 executive department appointments**, the Partnership for Public Service said. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/trump-cabinet-picks-inauguration.html))

2/ Trump boasted his inauguration would have an "unbelievable, perhaps record-setting turnout." **But aerial shots of the National Mall from Obama’s 2009 inauguration and today show that isn’t likely.** ([Vox](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/20/14332462/photos-crowd-trump-inauguration-vs-obama))

3/ **All references to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/trump-epa/">climate change</a> have been deleted** from the White House website. The only mention of climate on Trump’s new website is under his “America First Energy Plan” page, in which he vows to destroy Obama’s Climate Action Plan, which is a government-wide plan to reduce carbon emissions and address <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/trump-epa/">climate change</a>. ([Motherboard](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/all-references-to-climate-change-have-been-deleted-from-the-white-house-website))

4/ **New poll shows Obamacare is more popular than Donald Trump.** Fox News finds that 50% of voters feel favorably about the <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/trump-health-care/">Affordable Care Act</a> compared to Donald Trump, whom 42% view favorably. President Obama received an approval rating of 60%. ([Vox](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/20/14335268/obamacare-more-popular-than-trump-poll))

5/ **There's no record Trump has resigned from his companies.** To transfer control of his companies, the president has to submit filings in Florida, Delaware and New York. We spoke to officials in each of those states. ([ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-promised-to-resign-from-his-companies-but-no-record-hes-done-so))

6/ **Trump’s pick to be Treasury secretary failed to disclose nearly $100 million of his assets on Senate Finance Committee disclosure documents** and forgot to mention his role as a director of an investment fund located in a tax haven. Steven Mnuchin struggled to answer the Senate Finance Committee's questions about his use of tax havens as a hedge fund manager and whether he thought such loopholes should be closed. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/politics/steven-mnuchin-treasury-secretary-nominee-assets-confirmation.html))

7/ **Trump attacked the Washington establishment throughout his inaugural address, declaring that the " American carnage stops right here and stops right now."** Trump offered “a new vision will govern our land,” pledging that “From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/us/politics/donald-trump-inauguration-address.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-rattles-the-establishment-with-a-populist-inaugural-address-true-to-his-campaign/2017/01/20/f47f261c-df45-11e6-acdf-14da832ae861_story.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/key-points-of-trumps-inaugural-speech-233900))
