1/ **Steve Bannon was subpoenaed to testify in front of a grand jury as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/trump-russia-investigation/">Russia probe</a>**. It's the first time Mueller has used a grand jury subpoena to get information from someone in Trump's inner circle. Mueller, however, may end up letting Bannon forgo the grand jury appearance if he allows investigators to question him at the special counsel's offices in Washington.

2/ **Bannon met with the House Intelligence Committee this morning behind closed doors**. Lawmakers are sure to question Bannon on what he knew about the Trump Tower meeting, which he's previously called "treasonous."

* **Hope Hicks is expected to meet with the House Intelligence Committee as early as Friday**. The White House Communications Director will be one of the closest Trump confidants to be privately interviewed as part of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/trump-russia-investigation/">Russia probe</a>. The committee plans to ask her about any contacts that may have occurred between Trump associates and the Russians.

3/ **The government could shut down if lawmakers can't agree on a spending bill by Friday**. GOP leaders are looking to a short-term funding measure to keep certain government agencies open while talks continue, but Democrats are unlikely to support any deal that doesn't include protections for young undocumented immigrants who were brought to this country as children. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/shutdown-looms-as-republicans-seek-short-term-spending-deal-for-government/2018/01/15/4984c5aa-fa24-11e7-8f66-2df0b94bb98a_story.html))

4/ **Trump preemptively blamed democrats for a shutdown**, tweeting "The Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security. The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military, at a time we need it more than ever." Democrats presented Trump with a bipartisan immigration bill last week, and said Trump and Republicans would be to blame for a government shutdown. Current federal funding expires on Saturday.

6/ **Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed Trump can't be racist because he was on "The Apprentice."** Sanders said claims that Trump is racist were "outrageous," adding, "Frankly, if the critics of the president were who he said he was, why did NBC give him a show for a decade on TV?" ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-16/sanders-defends-trump-as-not-racist-citing-apprentice-tv-role))

7/ **The White House doctor said Trump is in "excellent" overall health and that he performed "well" on a cognitive exam**.
