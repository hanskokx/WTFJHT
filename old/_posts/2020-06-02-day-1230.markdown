1/ **Trump threatened to deploy ‚Äúthousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers‚Äù to end ‚Äúriots and lawlessness‚Äù if states and cities failed to quell the demonstrations sparked by the killing of George Floyd**. In a brief Rose Garden speech, Trump declared himself ‚Äúyour president of law and order" and said he would mobilize every available federal force, both ‚Äúcivilian and military,‚Äù to "quickly solve the problem" and end the nationwide protests. Trump denounced the violence as ‚Äúdomestic acts of terror‚Äù as he ordered governors and mayors to establish ‚Äúan overwhelming law enforcement presence." Trump, however, stopped short of invoking the Insurrection Act, which would allow him to deploy active duty U.S. troops to respond to protests in cities across the country. After Trump made the announcement, he left without taking questions from reporters.

* **Pentagon officials are reportedly "concerned" about Trump's threat to use the military to "dominate" protesters**. Officials have tried to make the case that the situation does not call for deploying active duty troops unless state governors make a clear argument such forces are needed.([CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/01/politics/troops-deploying-washington-dc/))

* **Twitter suspended a white nationalist group claiming to belong to an ‚Äúantifa‚Äù organization**.

* **Twitter added a warning label to a tweet by Rep.

Following his remarks in the Rose Garden, Trump left the White House and walked through Lafayette Square, where riot police and military police had cleared protesters moments before. Once Trump reached the far side of the square, he raised a bible in front of the church for a photo. Trump‚Äôs decision to speak to the nation from the Rose Garden and to then visit the church came together because he was reportedly upset about the news coverage of him retreating to the White House bunker amid the protests. Just before Trump spoke, Attorney General William Barr [personally](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/barr-personally-ordered-removal-of-protesters-near-white-house-leading-to-use-of-force-against-largely-peaceful-crowd/2020/06/02/0ca2417c-a4d5-11ea-b473-04905b1af82b_story.html) [ordered](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/02/politics/barr-protests-white-house/index.html) law enforcement officials to clear protesters from Lafayette Square.
