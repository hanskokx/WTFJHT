---

1/ **Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress, admitting that he continued to engage in negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow well into the 2016 presidential campaign**. Cohen previously said talks regarding the Moscow project stalled in January 2016, when in fact negotiations continued through June with Cohen traveling to Russia for meetings on the project. Cohen also told Congress that when the project allegedly stalled, he emailed Dmitry Peskov, a top aide to Putin, seeking help, but claimed he never received a response. That was also false. Cohen and Peskov discussed the project for 20 minutes by phone. Prosecutors also said that Cohen continued to have contact in 2016 with Felix Sater, a Russian developer assisting with the project. Cohen briefed Trump on the status of the project more than three times. In July 2016, Trump tweeted: "For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia." And, in January 2017, Trump told reporters that he had no deals in Russia because he had "stayed away." In exchange for pleading guilty and continuing to cooperate with Robert Mueller, he hopes to receive a lighter sentence.  It's Cohen's second guilty plea in four months.

Four months into the presidential campaign, Trump signed a ‚Äúletter of intent‚Äù to pursue building a Trump Tower in Moscow**. The involvement of then-candidate Trump in a proposed Russian development deal contradicts his repeated claims that his business had ‚Äúno relationship to Russia whatsoever."

2/ **Trump called Cohen a "weak" and "not a very smart person" for cooperating with Mueller, saying his former lawyer is "lying \[...\] to get a reduced sentence."** For the fourth straight morning, Trump attacked Mueller's investigation, musing whether it will "just go on forever."

3/ **Trump's written responses to Mueller about building a Trump Tower in Moscow during the campaign reportedly align with what Cohen said in court**, according to Trump's lawyers.

Given the fact that he's a liar, I can't tell you what he's lying about." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/us/politics/trump-cohen-moscow-trump-tower.html))

5/ **Trump made several calls from a blocked number in the middle of the night to Roger Stone during the 2016 campaign.** The call logs were turned over to Mueller and draw a direct line between Stone and Trump, which has rattled Trump's legal team and showed how closely the special counsel is scrutinizing their relationship.
