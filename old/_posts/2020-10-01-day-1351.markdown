2/ **Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to reach a deal on a new pandemic relief package**. House Democrats, meanwhile, plan to vote on a new $2.2 trillion relief bill that Republicans oppose.

3/ **Trump is the "single largest driver of misinformation" about COVID-19**, according to a study by Cornell University that analyzed 38 million worldwide articles about the pandemic. Researchers found that nearly 38% of the "misinformation conversation" began with Trump driving ‚Äùspikes‚Äù about "miracle cures" for COVID-19, such as the use of disinfectants, ultraviolet light, or unproven treatments like hydroxychloroquine.

4/ **Trump suggested that he won't "allow" the non-partisan Commission on Presidential Debates to change the format of the debates**. Trump's tweet ‚Äì "Why would I allow the Debate Commission to change the rules for the second and third Debates when I easily won last time?" ‚Äì comes a day after the commission announced that it would making changes to the format, including potentially allowing moderators to shut off the microphones if Trump or Biden break the rules. At Tuesday's debate, Trump interrupted Biden or the moderator at least 128 times. The commission said the event "made clear that additional structure should be added to the format of the remaining debates to ensure a more orderly discussion of the issues." The plans have not been finalized and the commission is still considering how it would carry out the plan.

5/ **White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany would not provide a declarative statement about whether or not Trump forcefully condemns white supremacy**. Instead, McEnany pointed to Trump's past statements denouncing the KKK and advocating for the death penalty for a white supremacist, while claiming that Trump's "record on this is unmistakable and it's shameful the media refuses to cover it." At one point, McEnany accused CNN's Kaitlan Collins of asking a "partisan attack question."

### ‚úèÔ∏è Notables.

1. **Federal law enforcement officials were instructed to be sympathetic public comments about the Kenosha shooter.** An internal Department of Homeland Security document directed officials to note that Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager charged with killing two protesters, "took his rifle to the scene of the rioting to help defend small business owners" and to say that the media incorrectly labeled the group Patriot Prayer as racists. Officials were also instructed to bring conversations back to the need to preserve law and order: "This is also why we need to stop the violence in our cities. Chaotic and violent situations lead to chaotic, violent and tragic outcomes. Everyone needs law and order." It is unclear whether any of the talking points originated at the White House or within Homeland Security's own press office.

2. **A federal judge blocked Trump's federal law enforcement commission from releasing a report on ways to improve policing**. Trump and Attorney General William Barr violated federal law by placing only current and former law-enforcement personnel on the 18-member commission, doing its work behind closed doors, and failing to include people with diverse views.
