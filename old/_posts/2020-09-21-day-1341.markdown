1/ **Trump urged Senate Republicans to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg ‚Äúwithout delay," tweeting that filling the seat is an "obligation" they must consider**. Trump, calling his shortlist of five candidates "the greatest list ever assembled," said he plans to name his pick to replace Ginsburg "either Friday or Saturday." Trump added that he wants the new justice confirmed before the November election, and promised that his nominee ‚Äúwill be a woman." Two GOP senators, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, both said they don't support voting on a new nominee before voters get to vote. Democrats need two more Republicans to defect in order to prevent a confirmation.

2/ **By the time you read this, 200,000 people will be dead from the coronavirus in the United States**.

Experts, meanwhile, are predicting a new spike of coronavirus cases this fall. And, more than half of U.S. states are reporting a rise in coronavirus cases with 27 states and Puerto Rico all reporting test positivity rates above 5% ‚Äì the threshold that the World Health Organization recommends municipalities hold steady for at least two weeks before businesses reopen.

3/ **Trump's political appointees tried to silence a top official at the CDC after she warned ‚Äúwe have way too much virus across the country.‚Äù** Anne Schuchat, CDC principal deputy director, had appealed to Americans to wear masks, saying she hoped the country could ‚Äútake it seriously and slow the transmission.‚Äù The next day in a June 30 email, Paul Alexander wrote to his boss, Michael Caputo, assistant secretary for public affairs at HHS, and reprimanded Schuchat, arguing that her comments contradicted Trump administration officials, including Pence. ‚ÄúImportantly, having the virus spread among the young and healthy is one of the methods to drive herd immunity,‚Äù Alexander added. ‚ÄúShe is duplicitous.‚Äù ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/us/politics/trump-cdc-coronavirus.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/09/18/caputo-censored-cdc-officials/))

4/ **The CDC reversed its previous guidance about how the coronavirus is transmitted, claiming that it had mistakenly posted a "draft" that stated that it was ‚Äúpossible‚Äù for the coronavirus to spread through airborne particles**, which can remain suspended in the air and travel beyond 6 feet. The updated guidance, which was posted on the CDC‚Äôs website on Friday, said the virus can be transmitted through tiny, aerosolized droplets that are "produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes." It also recommended that people use air purifiers to prevent the disease from spreading indoors. On Monday, however, the agency reverted to its previous language, saying the guidance was "posted in error" and that the virus is thought to spread "between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)." It was the third major revision to CDC information or guidelines published since May.

5/ **Heath and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar gave himself rule-making authority over the nation's health agencies, including the FDA**. In a Sept. 15 memo, Azar declared that power to sign any new rules related to the nation‚Äôs foods, medicines, medical devices and other products, including vaccines, ‚Äúis reserved to the Secretary.‚Äù The memo requires the secretary of HHS to sign any new rule.

6/ **A federal judge ordered Postmaster General Louis DeJoy to prioritize election mail and restore overtime for U.S. Postal Service employees**, saying that "managerial failures" at the agency undermined the public's faith in mail-in voting.

* **The USPS saw a decline in the rate of on-time delivery for first-class mail after Louis DeJoy took over as postmaster general in June.** According to new data, the changes implemented by DeJoy shortly after he took over led to reductions in the amount of First-Class mail that was delivered on time. The reductions in on-time deliveries and delivery speeds persisted even after DeJoy announced in August that he would suspend the changes until after the election.

* **A group of Trump supporters illegally disrupted early voting at a polling location in Virginia**. The group formed a line to force voters to walk around, while changing "four more years" and waving Trump flags. In Virginia, it is illegal to ‚Äúhinder or delay a qualified voter in entering or leaving a polling place,‚Äù and that any kind of political advocacy is prohibited within 40 feet of any entrance to a polling place.
