1/ **Nearly 1.2 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week** ‚Äì the 20th consecutive week with more than 1 million new claims. The decline comes after the extra $600 a week in pandemic-related unemployment benefits ended for millions of unemployed Americans. More than 32.1 million Americans are receiving some form of unemployment benefits.

2/ **The White House and Congress remain far apart on an agreement for a new coronavirus relief agreement**, with "no top-line numbers that have been agreed to," according to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Trump again threatened to act on his own to provide relief, saying he expects to sign an executive order on Friday or Saturday to extend enhanced unemployment benefits and impose a payroll tax break. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, meanwhile, stood up before a room full of Senate Republicans and declared that he is not "owned by Nancy." He added: "I can tell you those reports are false.‚Äù ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/06/coronavirus-stimulus-updates-mcconnell-thinks-dems-gop-will-reach-deal.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/us/politics/congress-coronavirus-stimulus.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/06/nancy-pelosi-coronavirus-relief-bill-391963) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-06/trump-says-he-may-sign-unemployment-benefit-extension-on-friday?srnd=premium&sref=MIBMEEoj))

3/ **Trump claimed ‚Äì without evidence‚Äì that it was possible the U.S. could have a coronavirus vaccine before the Nov. 3 election**, contradicting the timeline most health experts have called realistic. ‚ÄúSooner than the end of the year, could be much sooner,‚Äù Trump told Geraldo Rivera in an interview. When asked, ‚ÄúSooner than November 3?‚Äù Trump replied, ‚ÄúI think in some cases, yes, possible before, but right around that time.‚Äù Trump also said "it wouldn‚Äôt hurt‚Äù his reelection prospects if a vaccine became available before Election Day, but insisted "I want it fast because I want to save lives.‚Äù Experts, however, have said that if the development, testing, and production of a vaccine is able to hit certain criteria, then the earliest a vaccine could arrive is the end of the year or the beginning of 2021. Public health officials also estimate that more than 100 million American essential workers should get vaccinated before the general public, yet only 10 million to 20 million doses are expected to be available at first.

4/ **The New York prosecutors seeking Trump‚Äôs tax records have also subpoenaed Deutsche Bank**, his primary lender since the late 1990s, for financial records that he and his company provided to the bank. The Manhattan district attorney‚Äôs office issued the subpoena last year. In a court filing this week, Manhattan district attorney‚Äôs office [suggested](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/08/03/day-1292/#4-the-manhattan-district-attorney%E2%80%99s) that it‚Äôs investigating Trump and his company for bank and insurance fraud, citing ‚Äúpublic reports of possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization‚Äù and suggested that they were also investigating possible crimes involving bank and insurance fraud.

5/ **Facebook and Twitter both removed a Trump campaign post for spreading coronavirus misinformation**. Twitter temporarily blocked the Trump campaign account from tweeting until it deleted a video of Trump claiming that children are "almost immune from this disease." Facebook removed the same video, as well as hundreds of accounts from a foreign troll farm posing as African-Americans in support of Donald Trump and QAnon.
