1/ **Trump's national security advisor disputed reports of Russian interference in the 2020 election, saying there's "no intelligence behind" such claims**. Robert O'Brien suggested that the House Intelligence Committee either misheard or misinterpreted part of last week's briefing, and that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not mean to say that it believes the Russians are currently intervening in the election to help Trump. The U.S. intelligence community also clarified that Russia is interfering in the 2020 election and has separately assessed that Russia views Trump as a preferred leader. The intelligence community, however, says it does not have evidence that Russia's interference is aimed at reelecting Trump.

* **üìå [Day 1127](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/02/20/day-1127/#1-an-intelligence-official-in-charge): An intelligence official in charge of election security warned the House Intelligence Committee last week that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get Trump re-elected**. Trump‚Äôs allies challenged the conclusions by Shelby Pierson during the meeting, arguing that Trump has been tough on Russia and strengthened European security. Trump reportedly "erupted" and "berated" his acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, in the Oval Office following the meeting over what he perceived as disloyalty. Trump also erroneously believed that Pierson had given information exclusively to Rep. Adam Schiff, complaining that Democrats would ‚Äúweaponize‚Äù the disclosure. Yesterday, Trump announced that he was replacing Maguire with Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and a vocal Trump supporter.

Shelby Pierson, the intelligence community‚Äôs election threats expert, briefed the House Intelligence Committee last week that Russia was determined to interfere in the 2020 primaries and general election. Following the briefing, Trump blamed Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, for allowing the information about Russia's meddling efforts to be included and for not informing him in advance. Trump then announced that he was replacing Maguire with Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany and a Trump supporter.

2/ **Trump accused Adam Schiff ‚Äî without evidence ‚Äî of leaking classified information about Russian election interference to the media**. "Somebody please tell incompetent (thanks for my high poll numbers) & corrupt politician Adam ‚ÄòShifty‚Äô Schiff to stop leaking Classified information or, even worse, made up information, to the Fake News Media," Trump tweeted. "Someday he will be caught, & that will be a very unpleasant experience!" Trump was referring to the meeting between an intelligence official in charge of election security and members of the House Intelligence Committee, during which Shelby Pierson told members that Russia has "developed a preference" for Trump and is trying to make sure he is reelected.

3/ **Trump told aides he wants fewer people working in the White House and only loyalists working in certain administration positions**. Aides say Trump is convinced that his administration is filled with "snakes" and that he's on the hunt for the "bad people" inside the White House and government who he's been "warned about." This follows reports that Trump's allies have compiled a list over the last 18 months of government employees they've identified as disloyal. Meanwhile, John McEntee, Trump's former body man who was recently took over the Office of Presidential Personnel and reports directly to Trump, has ordered a freeze on all political appointments across the government. He's also instructed departments to search for people not loyal to Trump's agenda so they can be removed.

4/ **Trump‚Äôs new acting intelligence director used to work for an Eastern European oligarch who the U.S. accused of corruption**. Richard Grenell's public relations firm was paid to write articles in 2016 defending the Moldovan politician Vladimir Plahotniuc. Grenell did not register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act ‚Äì¬†the same law that Paul Manafort and Rick Gates were convicted of violating¬†‚Äì and never disclosed that he was being paid to write the articles. In January, Plahotniuc was banned from entering the U.S., citing his alleged ‚Äúcorrupt actions‚Äù which ‚Äúundermined the rule of law and severely compromised the independence of democratic institutions in Moldova.‚Äù ([ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trumps-new-spy-chief-used-to-work-for-a-foreign-politician-the-us-accused-of-corruption) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/richard-grenells-paid-consulting-included-work-for-us-nonprofit-funded-mostly-by-hungary/2020/02/24/003322d4-558a-11ea-929a-64efa7482a77_story.html))
