But there‚Äôs a bigger bomb if you fire him.‚Äù Trump's comments came a day after Fauci said is was ‚Äúabsolutely not" surprised that Trump contracted COVID-19 after seeing him on TV in a "completely precarious situation" with "almost nobody wearing a mask."

Stepien said the commission had "turned the entire debate season into a fiasco.‚Äù ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/19/us/trump-vs-biden?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage#trump-who-withdrew-from-the-last-debate-seeks-changes-to-the-next))
