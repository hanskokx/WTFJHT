### ‚öñÔ∏è Trump‚Äôs Senate Impeachment Trial:

**What happened Saturday?** Trump‚Äôs legal team began their opening arguments by seeking to cast doubt on Democrats‚Äô case that Trump tried to pressure Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden. Over the course of a two-hour session, Trump's lawyer Pat Cipollone and his deputy Michael Purpura argued that Trump had valid reasons for withholding military aid from Ukraine and that House prosecutors overlooked facts, noting that witnesses in the House's impeachment hearings based their assessments on "presumptions" and "guesswork" rather than knowledge of Trump's intentions. "We don't believe that they have come anywhere close to meeting their burden for what they're asking you to do," Cipollone said. They also argued that the words Trump spoke on his July 25 call to Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, conveyed no pressure ‚Äî and that Ukrainians never publicly expressed any. Cipollone added that Democrats are "asking you to tear up all of the ballots all across the country" and "perpetrate the most massive interference in an election in American history.‚Äù

**What happened today?** Trump‚Äôs team continued with their opening statements, arguing about the basis of the House‚Äôs impeachment inquiry and the Trump's rights of due process and executive privilege. Trump‚Äôs lawyers ‚Äì ignoring John Bolton's disclosure that Trump said he wanted to continue a freeze on military aid to Ukraine until officials helped with investigations into Trump‚Äôs political rivals ‚Äì told senators that no evidence existed tying Trump's decision to withhold security aid from Ukraine to his insistence on the investigations, arguing that Trump did nothing wrong and the impeachment inquiry was illegitimate from the start. Alan Dershowitz claimed that "Nothing in the Bolton revelations, even if true, would rise to the level of an abuse of power, or an impeachable offense." A handful of Republicans, meanwhile, appeared to be moving closer to joining Democrats in a vote to subpoena Bolton. Pam Bondi, one of Trump's lawyers, accused Democrats of denying the legitimacy of investigations into the Bidens because the House case depends on the premise that Trump was only interested in the negative political impact on his rival. Jane Raskin, a member of Trump's defense team, also called Rudy Giuliani a ‚Äúcolorful distraction.‚Äù

1/ **Trump told former national security adviser John Bolton in August that he wanted to continue freezing $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine until Ukrainian officials helped with investigations into Biden** and other Democrats, according to an unpublished manuscript of Bolton‚Äôs forthcoming book,  [‚ÄúThe Room Where It Happened."](https://amzn.to/36zod6u) Bolton‚Äôs account directly contradicts one of Trump‚Äôs defense arguments, that there was no quid pro quo when he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son in the July phone call. Bolton‚Äôs account was included in drafts of a manuscript he circulated to close associates. A draft was also sent to the White House for a standard review process on Dec. 30 ‚Äî 12 days after Trump was impeached. The White House ordered Bolton and other key officials with firsthand knowledge of Trump‚Äôs dealings not to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/us/politics/trump-bolton-book-ukraine.html))

* **Trump claimed that he ‚ÄúNEVER‚Äù told Bolton that military aid to Ukraine was conditioned on investigations into Biden and his son**. Trump cited his first face-to-face meeting with Zelensky at the United Nations in September, and asserted that he ‚Äúreleased the military aid to Ukraine without any conditions or investigations - and far ahead of schedule.‚Äù ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/27/trump-john-bolton-ukraine-aid-105942) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/us/politics/trump-bolton-twitter.html) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/27/trump-rages-after-bolton-book-reportedly-claims-president-tied-ukraine-aid-to-probes.html))

* **Mitch McConnell didn't know that Trump's administration had a copy of the Bolton manuscript**. McConnell, who has said he's in "total coordination" with the White House on the impeachment trial, reportedly isn't happy. ([Courier-Journal](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/mitch-mcconnell/2020/01/27/trump-impeachment-mcconnell-angry-white-house-over-john-bolton-book/4589461002/))

2/ **Congressional Democrats called for Bolton to testify in Trump‚Äôs impeachment trial** following the report that Trump told Bolton last August that he wanted to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless it aided investigations into the Bidens. In a joint statement, the seven House impeachment managers called the report ‚Äúexplosive‚Äù and urged Senate Republicans to agree to call Bolton as a witness in Trump‚Äôs trial. Bolton has said that he would testify before the Senate if subpoenaed. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted that because of the report that Bolton had firsthand knowledge of Trump's decision that ran counter to the White House's account, the "refusal of the Senate to call for him, other relevant witnesses, and documents is now even more indefensible."

3/ **Senate Republicans have privately discussed a ‚Äúone-for-one‚Äù witness deal**. Patrick Toomey has privately spoken with several colleagues ‚Äì¬†including Mitt Romney ‚Äì about possibly summoning two witnesses to Trump‚Äôs impeachment trial. Romney, Susan Collins, and Lisa Murkowski have previously said they're open to hearing from Bolton. Following the revelations from Bolton‚Äôs unpublished manuscript, Romney and Collins said it's "increasingly likely" other Republicans will vote to call witnesses.

4/ **A video made public captures Trump saying he wants to ‚Äúget rid‚Äù of the then-U.S. ambassador to Ukraine during an April 2018 meeting that included Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman**. The video, recorded on Fruman's phone, contradicts Trump's statements that he didn't know Parnas or Fruman, who both worked with Rudy Giuliani to push for the ousting of Marie Yovanovitch, who was ultimately removed from her post in April 2019. Trump also asked how long Ukraine would be able to resist Russian aggression without U.S. assistance during the dinner.

* **üìå [Day 1100](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/01/24/day-1100/#3-trump-appeared-to-order-two-rudy-g): Trump appeared to order two Rudy Giuliani associates to ‚Äúget rid‚Äù of then-US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch during a dinner in April 2018 at the Trump International Hotel**, according to a recording made by Igor Fruman. ‚ÄúGet her out tomorrow. I don‚Äôt care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. Okay? Do it,‚Äù Trump reportedly said of Yovanovitch after being told by Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman that the career foreign service officer was ‚Äúbadmouthing‚Äù him in Kiev. Parnas turned over the recording to the House Intelligence Committee. Trump claimed in November that didn‚Äôt ‚Äúknow much‚Äù about Yovanovitch when he signed off on recalling her from Kiev. Pence defended Trump after the 2018 recording emerged, saying ‚ÄúAll of the ambassadors for the United States of America serve at the pleasure of the president of the United States.‚Äù ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/recording-appears-capture-trump-private-dinner-ukraine-ambassador/story?id=68506437) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/us/politics/trump-recording-yovanovitch.html) / [Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/rudy-pal-igor-fruman-taped-trump-trying-to-fire-ukraine-ambassador-lawyer) / [Talking Points Memo](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/report-trump-recorded-telling-parnas-and-fruman-to-take-her-out-about-yovanovitch))

5/ **Trump tweeted that Rep. Adam Schiff has "has not paid the price, yet,"** attacking Schiff as ‚Äúa CORRUPT POLITICIAN, and probably a very sick man." Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and the lead impeachment manager in the Senate trial, responded by urging Republican senators to find the ‚Äúmoral courage to stand up‚Äù to a ‚Äúwrathful and vindictive president.‚Äù ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/schiff-has-not-paid-the-price-for-impeachment-trump-says-in-what-appears-to-be-veiled-threat/2020/01/26/539e26ee-404a-11ea-b503-2b077c436617_story.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/us/politics/trump-schiff-impeachment.html))

6/ **Secretary of State Mike Pompeo abruptly ended an interview with NPR after the reporter asked about the Trump administration‚Äôs firing of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine**. Immediately after the question on Ukraine, Pompeo glared at Mary Louise Kelly for several seconds before leaving the room. A few moments later, an aide asked Kelly to follow her into Pompeo's private living room at the State Department without a recorder. Inside the room, Pompeo shouted his displeasure for being questioned about Ukraine, repeatedly used the ‚Äúf-word,‚Äù and challenged Kelly to find Ukraine on an unlabeled map, which she did. Pompeo then said, "People will hear about this." Pompeo later accused Kelly of [lying](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/25/799562818/after-contentious-interview-pompeo-publicly-accuses-npr-journalist-of-lying-to-h) and [being part](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/us/politics/pompeo-mary-louise-kelly.html) of an ‚Äúunhinged‚Äù media conspiracy ‚Äúin a quest to hurt President Trump and this administration."

Pompeo never said whether he owed Marie Yovanovitch an apology.
