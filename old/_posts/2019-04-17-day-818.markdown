1/ **Attorney General William Barr directed immigration judges to deny some asylum seekers the opportunity to post bail after being detained**. Previously, migrants who established "a credible fear of persecution or torture" in their home country were eligible to seek release on bond. Now they could end up being jailed indefinitely while they wait months or years for their claims to be processed. The Department of Homeland Security will have the discretion to decide whether to release immigrants who initially crossed the border illegally, but later claimed asylum. The order will go into effect in 90 days.

2/ **Trump vetoed a bipartisan resolution to end American military involvement in the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen**. Earlier this month, Congress voted to invoke the War Powers Resolution to try to stop U.S. involvement in the foreign conflict. Trump called it "an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities." The veto – the second of Trump's presidency – comes a month after he vetoed a resolution to reverse his national emergency declaration aimed at securing funding for a border wall.

3/ **Trump's attorneys and the White House plan to resist congressional requests for information** about security clearances approvals, Trump's meetings with foreign leaders, and other topics the administration deems subject to executive privilege. While House Democrats say they'll continue to issue subpoenas, they also said they have little confidence that Barr will enforce contempt actions if their demands are ignored. Congressional subpoenas — and any criminal contempt proceedings — expire at the end of a congressional session. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-moves-to-resist-house-inquiries-setting-up-fight-over-congressional-subpoena-powers/2019/04/16/49f4c75c-6057-11e9-9412-daf3d2e67c6d_story.html))

4/ **Barr and Rod Rosenstein will hold a press conference to discuss the Robert Mueller report at 9:30 am ET Thursday**.
