"Sometime in September, we're going to cross 200,000, and we still won't be done," Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute said. "This pandemic is going to be with us until next spring or summer when we have a vaccine. This is not faded." Jha explained that if the current number of coronavirus deaths per day in the U.S. ‚Äî between 800 and 1,000 ‚Äî stays the same, roughly 25,000 to 30,000 people will continue to die every month.

* **Trump‚Äôs coronavirus task force told governors they are worried about a spike in infections due to the protests taking place across the country**.

2/ **The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff apologized for participating in Trump's photo op at St. John's Church**, saying it ‚Äúwas a mistake that I have learned from." Gen. Mark Milley walked with Trump across Lafayette Square for a photo after the authorities used tear gas and rubber bullets to clear the area of peaceful protesters. ‚ÄúI should not have been there," Milley said. "My presence in that moment, and in that environment, created the perception of the military involved in domestic politics.‚Äù ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/11/politics/milley-trump-appearance-mistake/index.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/11/mark-milley-trump-church-walk-313074) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/us/politics/trump-milley-military-protests-lafayette-square.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2020/06/11/pentagons-top-general-apologizes-appearing-alongside-trump-lafayette-square/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/mark-milley-apologizes-trump-church-photo-op-e6e09b9e-3af7-49df-b651-dd0fcb82e6f2.html))

* **The Army's 3rd Infantry Regiment was issued bayonets in scabbards and live ammunition in case active-duty troops were deployed in the U.S. capital last week**. As many as 800 members of the Army‚Äôs ‚ÄúOld Guard‚Äù were on alert. The ‚ÄúOld Guard‚Äù is based at Fort Myer, just out of Washington.

3/ **Trump threatened to intervene and "take back" Seattle, tweeting that the protesters who have taken over several city blocks were ‚Äúdomestic terrorists‚Äù while blaming the city‚Äôs ‚Äúradical left‚Äù Democratic leadership for the situation**. After more than a week of demonstrations, city leaders closed the Seattle Police Department‚Äôs East Precinct and allowed demonstrations to continue without police presence. Since then, protesters proclaimed the area the ‚ÄúCapitol Hill Autonomous Zone,‚Äù where the police are forbidden, food is free, and people discuss priorities, and listen to speeches and poetry readings. Documentaries are also screened at night. ‚ÄúThis space is now property of the Seattle people,‚Äù reads a banner hung from the entrance of the now-empty police station. There have been no incidents of violence or looting. Trump, however, tweeted for Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee to ‚Äútake back your city NOW,‚Äù adding that ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt do it, I will.‚Äù He continued: ‚ÄúThis is not a game. These ugly Anarchists must be stooped \[sic\] IMMEDIATELY. MOVE FAST!‚Äù Inslee responded, saying he ‚Äúwill not allow‚Ä¶ threats of military violence against Washingtonians coming from the White House." Durkan added: ‚ÄúMake us all safe. Go back to your bunker.‚Äù ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/us/capitol-hill-autonomous-zone-seattle-trump.html) / [Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/trump-inslee-trade-twitter-barbs-over-capitol-hill-protest-zone-known-as-chaz/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/11/politics/seattle-mayor-trump-protests/index.html) / [KOMO News](https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/president-trump-calls-for-inslee-durkan-to-take-back-city-now-amid-protests) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/06/11/trump-seattle-autonomous-zone-inslee/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/11/trump-seattle-protests-jay-inslee-313278) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/502241-inslee-calls-on-trump-to-stay-out-of-washington-states-business) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/11/trump-seattle-threats-protests-twitter-complaints))

4/ **Trump will hold a campaign rally on Juneteenth, a holiday marking the emancipation of slaves, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the site of the 1921 massacre of hundreds of African Americans**. The campaign is not expected to implement any social distancing measures or compel attendees to wear masks because Trump has deemed it unnecessary and has made it clear he doesn't want it to look like he's speaking in front of a crowd that looks empty. Meanwhile, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany claimed that Juneteenth is a "meaningful day" to Trump.

5/ **Trump administration will not disclose the amounts or recipients of $511 billion in taxpayer-backed coronavirus loans**, backtracking on an earlier commitment to release individual loan data. ‚ÄúAs it relates to the names and amounts of specific PPP loans, we believe that that‚Äôs proprietary information, and in many cases for sole proprietors and small businesses, it is confidential information,‚Äù Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at a hearing before the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/11/trump-administration-wont-say-who-got-511-billion-taxpayer-backed-coronavirus-loans/))

6/ **The Senate Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to authorize subpoenas targeting former Obama administration officials involved in the counterintelligence investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia**.
