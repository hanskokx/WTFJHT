1/ **The House Ways and Mean Committee subpoenaed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over Trump's tax returns**. IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig was also subpoenaed. Chairman Richard Neal gave Mnuchin and Rettig until until May 17 to turn over six years of Trump's returns, and is expected to go to court to enforce his request if the Trump administration continues to argue that the committee does not have a legitimate legislative purpose that warrants compliance. Earlier this week, Mnuchin rejected Neal's request for the returns. Trump previously vowed to fight all subpoenas from House Democrats. Subpoenas are now pending from the Ways and Means, Judiciary, Oversight and Reform, Financial Services, and the Intelligence Committees.

2/ **The House Judiciary Committee introduced the "No President Is Above the Law Act"** that would "pause the statute of limitations for any federal offense committed by a sitting president." The move is an attempt to get around a Justice Department ruling that a sitting president cannot be indicted or criminally prosecuted. Robert Mueller laid out extensive evidence of possible obstruction by Trump, but declined to exonerate Trump in his report, citing a Justice Department legal opinion that a sitting president cannot be indicted.

3/ **Robert Mueller won't testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee next week**, but "he will come at some point," committee chairman Jerrold Nadler told reporters. The committee is still negotiating with the Justice Department for Mueller's appearance. "If it's necessary," Nadler said, "we will subpoena him and he will come." Mueller was tentatively scheduled to appear May 15th.

4/ **Trump escalated his trade war with China**, raising tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and moving ahead to tax nearly all of China's imports. Trump said the move is meant to punish China for attempting to "renegotiate" a trade deal between the two countries. At one point, Trump mentioned that he received a "beautiful letter" from Chinese President Xi Jinping, who wanted to speak with him on the phone, but later said he would be more than happy to keep hitting China with tariffs. "I have no idea what's going to happen," Trump said, tweeting later that there is "no need to rush" on to securing a trade deal with China.

2. **The House passed a $19.1 billion disaster relief package** for farmers and communities hit by hurricanes, wildfires, floods and other natural disasters, including Puerto Rico.

6. **The Department of Housing and Urban Development confirmed the Trump administration's plan to evict undocumented immigrants from public housing could displace more than 55,000 children**. The proposed rule would make it harder for undocumented immigrants to access public housing, in order to "make certain our scarce public resources help those who are legally entitled to it," according to HUD Secretary Ben Carson. The agency's own analysis found that half of the people currently living in households facing eviction and homelessness under the new rule are children who are legally qualified for aid.
