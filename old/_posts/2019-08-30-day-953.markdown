1/ **Trump's longtime personal assistant was fired after bragging to reporters that she had a better relationship with Trump than Ivanka or Tiffany Trump – his own daughters**. Madeleine Westerhout also told reporters that Trump did not like being in pictures with Tiffany because he thought she was overweight. Westerhout comments happened at an off-the-record dinner with reporters in Bedminster, N.J.

2/ **Trump formally established the U.S. military's Space Command**, which will be responsible for protecting American interests in what he called "the next war-fighting domain." Space Command will consist 287 personnel, but could draw troops from other branches of the military, as well as from Trump's proposed Space Force, the sixth branch of the military that is currently waiting to be approved by Congress. Space Command's location has yet to be determined, but the Pentagon is currently considering six locations at bases in Colorado, Alabama and California.

3/ **The Federal Election Commission no longer has enough commissioners to legally meet** after the vice chairman resigned earlier this week. With Matthew Petersen gone, the FEC will be down to three members and won't have a quorum. The agency is supposed to serve as the watchdog over how money is raised and spent in American elections.

4/ **Trump canceled his planned trip to Poland to monitor Hurricane Dorian, which is threatening to strike Florida near Mar-a-Lago**. The storm is projected to make landfall as a Category 4 hurricane on Monday, with Melbourne as the most likely landing spot – about 115 miles north of where Trump's ocean-front hotel is situated. Mar-a-Lago remains in the "cone of uncertainty." Trump had been set to travel to Poland to participate in a World War II commemoration ceremony. Pence will make the trip instead.
