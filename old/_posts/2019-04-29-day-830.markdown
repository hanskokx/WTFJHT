1/ **Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein resigned**, effective May 11th. In his resignation letter to Trump, Rosenstein writes "I am grateful to you for the opportunity to serve; for the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations." Rosenstein's successor, Jeffrey Rosen, currently the No. 2 official at the Transportation Department, is awaiting a confirmation vote by the Senate. Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. *\[Breaking news... stay tuned for updates\]* ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2019/04/29/deputy-attorney-general-rod-rosenstein-to-resign-effective-may-11/) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/deputy-attorney-general-rod-rosenstein-submits-resignation-letter-11556572633) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/29/politics/rod-rosenstein/index.html) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2019/04/29/601484448/rod-rosenstein-face-of-russia-probe-to-step-down-as-deputy-attorney-general))

* **üìå [Day 110](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/05/09/Day-110/#1-trump-fired-james-comey-on-the-rec): Trump fired James Comey on the recommendation of Jeff Sessions**. In a letter dated Tuesday to Comey, Trump concurred "with the judgment of the Department of Justice that \[Comey is not\] able to effectively lead the bureau." Earlier today, the FBI notified Congress that Comey misstated key findings involving the Clinton email investigation during testimony, saying that only a "small number" of emails had been forwarded to disgraced congressman Anthony Weiner, not the "hundreds and thousands" he‚Äôd claimed in his testimony. The move sweeps away the man who is responsible for the investigation into whether members of Trump's campaign team colluded with Russia in its interference in last year's election. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein laid out the reasons for Comey's firing, arguing that the handling of his investigation into Clinton's private server, his decision not to recommend charges be filed, and the news conference he held to explain his reasoning were the cause of his dismissal. Democrats reacted with shock and alarm, accusing Trump of ousting the FBI director to escape scrutiny over his campaign‚Äôs Russia ties. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer urged deputy Rosenstein to appoint a special prosecutor for the federal probe into the Trump campaign‚Äôs ties with Russian officials ‚Äî warning that failing to do so will lead the public to ‚Äúrightly suspect‚Äù that Comey‚Äôs surprise firing ‚Äúwas part of a cover-up.‚Äù ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/comey-misstated-key-clinton-email-evidence-at-hearing-say-people-close-to-investigation/2017/05/09/074c1c7e-34bd-11e7-b373-418f6849a004_story.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/us/politics/james-comey-fired-fbi.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-fires-fbi-director-james-comey-n757101) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/09/politics/james-comey-fbi-trump-white-out/) / [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/09/comey-firing-congress-reaction-238180))

Mueller will take command of the prosecutors and FBI agents who are working on the far reaching[Russia investigation](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/trump-russia-investigation/). Trump said that he expects the probe will find no collusion between his 2016 White House campaign and foreign countries, calling the Russia inquiry a ‚Äútaxpayer-funded charade."

* **üìå [Day 610](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/09/21/day-610/#4-rod-rosenstein-raised-the-idea-of): Rod Rosenstein raised the idea of wearing a wire last year to secretly record Trump in the White House and expose the chaos in the administration**, according to memos written by Andrew McCabe, then the acting FBI director. Rosenstein also discussed recruiting Jeff Sessions and John Kelly, then the secretary of homeland security, to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove Trump from office. Rosenstein called the report "inaccurate and factually incorrect," adding: "Based on my personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment." At least one person who was present for the discussions said Rosenstein was joking.

Speaking at the Public Servants Dinner of the Armenian Bar Association, Rosenstein recalled how he had promised to "do it right" during his Senate confirmation hearing and "take it to the appropriate conclusion," while attacking what he called "mercenary critics," politicians and the news media. Rosenstein, however, also warned that hacking and social media ma¬≠nipu¬≠la¬≠tion are "only the tip of the iceberg" when it comes to Russian efforts to influence American elections.

3/ **Trump accused the New York attorney general's office of "illegally" investigating the NRA** after it opened an investigation into potential financial and disclosure misconduct by the gun rights group. The probe was launched after NRA President Oliver North accused Wayne LaPierre, chief executive officer, of financial misconduct, including the improper use of $200,000 of NRA funds to purchase clothing from an NRA vendor. Trump encouraged the NRA to "get its act together quickly" because it's a "very important organization" that is "under siege" by Democrats.

The shooting is being investigated as a possible homicide, hate crime and federal civil rights violation. John Earnest reportedly posted a manifesto full of anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim views and claiming responsibility before the shooting on the online message board 8chan. Trump offered his condolences to members of the synagogue, saying Americans "forcefully condemn the evil of anti-Semitism and hate."

At the time, Trump condemned what happened "on many sides," arguing there were "very fine people on both sides" of the incident. Now, nearly two years later, Trump stands by his statement, claiming that he answered questions about the incident in Charlottesville "perfectly." Trump's comments came a day after Joe Biden launched his presidential campaign with a [video](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/25/politics/joe-biden-charlottesville-trump-2020-launch/index.html) comparing the violence and racism displayed in Charlottesville to Trump's response.
