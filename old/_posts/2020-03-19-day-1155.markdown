1/ **The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee warned constituents three weeks ago to prepare for dire economic and societal effects from the coronavirus**. "There's one thing that I can tell you about this: It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history," Sen. Richard Burr said on Feb. 27, according to a secret recording of the remarks. "It is probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic." On that same day, Trump suggested that the virus is "going to disappear. One day, it's like a miracle. It will disappear," before adding, "it could get worse before it gets better. It could maybe go away. We'll see what happens." On Feb 13., Burr sold off between $582,029 and $1.56 million of his holdings despite reassuring the public at the time that the government had the coronavirus outbreak under control. A week later, the stock market began a sharp decline and has lost about 30% since.

* **üö® The Trump administration simulated a series of pandemic outbreaks from China in 2019 and found the U.S. government response was ‚Äúunderfunded, underprepared, and uncoordinated."** The series of exercises resulted in some 110 million sick Americans, leading to 7.7 million hospitalizations, and 586,000 deaths. The draft report, marked ‚Äúnot to be disclosed,‚Äù detailed repeated cases of ‚Äúconfusion‚Äù during the exercises.

* **Trump agreed with a reporter from a right-wing outlet who accused "major left wing news media" of "siding with state propaganda" from China for criticizing his use of the term "Chinese virus."** Trump went on to call the Washington Post, New York Times, and Wall Street Journal of being "very dishonest‚Äù and siding with Chinese propaganda days after calling news media coverage of the coronavirus pandemic ‚Äúvery fair." Trump added that he wanted to remove 75% to 80% of the journalists in the briefing room in the name of social distancing.

2/ **Trump promised that a therapeutic drug would be available ‚Äúalmost immediately‚Äù only to be contradicted minutes later by the commissioner of the FDA**. The drug, chloroquine, hasn‚Äôt yet been approved for treatment of COVID-19, but Trump ‚Äì for some reason ‚Äì asserted that it was, and that he wanted to ‚Äúremove every barrier‚Äù to test more drugs and ‚Äúallow many more Americans to access drugs that have shown really good promise.‚Äù FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, however, cautioned that use of the drug ‚Äì used to combat malaria ‚Äì would first need to be part of a controlled trial to find out whether or not it works, and if so, what dose would be safe and effective. Trump, meanwhile, claimed that "it‚Äôs not going to kill anybody."

* **U.S. hospitals requested $100 billion in direct financial assistance from Congress to respond to the coronavirus pandemic** as some hospitals are already running short of supplies for both patients and health care workers. The American Hospital Association warned congressional leaders that ‚Äúmore needs to be urgently done" after two legislative packages, which did not provide direct funding for hospitals, were signed into law. The hospital association also urged Trump to use the Defense Production Act to direct American manufacturers to produce the needed supplies.

* **Trump suggested that cruise ships could be used as floating hospitals to help relieve stress on the health care system**.

5/ **Senate Republicans introduced a $1 trillion emergency coronavirus stimulus bill, which includes direct cash payments for some Americans**. The proposal calls for $1,200 direct payments to individuals making $75,000 or less based on a 2018 tax return, or $2,400 for couples filing jointly, plus $500 per child. The payments would decrease for those making more than $75,000, and is capped at $99,000 per individual or $198,000 for couples.

The new rules would eliminate states' ability to waive work and time requirements for SNAP recipients in areas with high unemployment rates.
