* ***Editor's note**: The White House coronavirus task force briefing just started and a last-minute dispute over unemployment aid is delaying a Senate vote on the aid package. Per usual, who the f\*ck knows what's going to happen. So instead of waiting indefinitely, here we go instead*.

1/ **Senators reached an agreement on a $2 trillion stimulus package to combat the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic** ‚Äì the largest relief package in American history. The package will provide direct payments to Americans, $130 billion in funding for hospitals, $350 billion in small business loans, $250 billion in unemployment insurance benefits, and $500 billion in loans for distressed companies. A vote is expected Wednesday afternoon. The House is expected to take it up no sooner than Thursday. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin promised that Trump would "absolutely" sign it if Congress passes it. The package is the third Congress has considered to address the pandemic. Trump previously signed into law a $8.3 billion emergency aid and relief package providing paid leave, free testing and additional aid for families affected by the pandemic.
