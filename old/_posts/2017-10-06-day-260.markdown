1/ **Trump's advisers are floating the idea of replacing Rex Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo after [Morongate](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/10/04/day-258/#1-rex-tillerson-reportedly-called-tr)**. Trump was reportedly furious that Tillerson didn't deny he called the president a "fucking moron," leaving many to believe their relationship is broken beyond repair. Tillerson praised Trump and insisted he never considered resigning in a public statement he made later that day.

2/ **Surrounded by military leaders, Trump warned that "maybe it’s the calm before the storm."** The unprompted comment came during a photo-op at the White House with the top national security officials. “We have the world’s great military leaders in this room,” Trump said to reporters. When pressed to explain what he meant, he simply said: "You’ll find out." ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/05/trump-calm-before-the-storm-243519))

3/ **Robert Mueller's investigators met with the author of the Trump dossier**, Christopher Steele, this past summer in an effort to understand if people associated with the Trump campaign and suspected Russian operatives broke any laws. US intelligence agencies reportedly took the Steele dossier more seriously than previously acknowledged, keeping it out of a publicly-released January report on Russian meddling in order to not divulge which parts of the dossier they had corroborated. Trump and his allies have repeatedly called the dossier "totally made-up stuff" written by a "failed spy."

4/ **Christopher Steele is talking with the Senate Intelligence Committee about formally speaking with its leaders**. The sticking point for the former British intelligence operative, who authored a 35-page dossier alleging that the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia, has been over his unwillingness to discuss who underwrote his work. Steele was hired by Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research, which was originally funded by undisclosed Republican opponents of Trump. During the general election, unknown Democrats began picking up the tab. Senators had previously said they have had [unable to get traction](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/10/04/day-258/#3-the-senate-intelligence-committee) on the dossier, because Steele had not agreed to meet with investigators or the senators.

5/ **White House tech support believes John Kelly's personal cellphone was compromised**.

Other news outlets have not confirmed the authenticity of the memo. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/05/john-kelly-cell-phone-compromised-243514))

* **ACLU filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the roll back of the birth control mandate**. The rollback “basically gives broad license to employers to discriminate against their employees and withhold a benefit guaranteed by law,” said Brigitte Amiri, senior staff attorney at the ACLU.
