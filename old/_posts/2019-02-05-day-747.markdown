1/ **Federal prosecutors in New York requested interviews with Trump Organization executives**. New York federal prosecutors are running at least two investigations into Trump-related entities: the first centers on Cohen's possible campaign-finance violations for the hush-money payments made or organized to silence women who claimed affairs with Trump. The second concerns the Trump inaugural committee. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/05/politics/new-york-federal-prosecutors-trump-organization-executives/index.html))

2/ **Trump's inaugural committee was ordered to turn over documents related to donations and spending** following a subpoena by the Southern District of New York. Federal prosecutors are seeking all information about donors, vendors, contractors, bank accounts, and foreign contributors related to the inaugural committee, which raised a record $107 million ‚Äì more than twice the amount raised to fund Obama's 2009 inaugural. Federal prosecutors are also seeking documents related to a Los Angeles venture capitalist, Imaad Zuberi, who gave $900,000 to the committee through his private-equity firm, Avenue Ventures, and once registered as a foreign agent working on behalf of the Sri Lankan government. The subpoena suggests that SDNY prosecutors are investigating crimes related to conspiracy to defraud the U.S., mail fraud, false statements, wire fraud, and money laundering. The investigation is being led by the public corruption unit of the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, and grew out of the probe into Michael Cohen's business dealings. Cohen has since pleaded guilty to eight charges and has been sentenced to three years in prison.

3/ **Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed the Trump inaugural committee subpoena "has nothing to do with the White House,"** as she deferred questions to the committee, which is a separate entity from the White House. Sanders also dismissed the notion that Trump is a common factor in his inner circle's legal issues, arguing instead that "the common thread is a hysteria over the fact that this president became president."

4/ **SDNY prosecutors have been interviewing witnesses about foreign money flowing to three lobbying firms recruited by Paul Manafort** to improve the image of the Russia-aligned president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, seven years ago. Mercury Public Affairs, the Podesta Group and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom are being scrutinized for representing foreign governments without registering as foreign agents. The case was originally referred by Mueller's investigation. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/us/politics/paul-manafort-news-ukraine.html))

5/ **Trump and Jared Kushner met with contractors at the White House to discuss building the border wall last week**, despite senior Senate Republicans and members of GOP leadership raising concerns about Trump bypassing Congress and using an emergency declaration to build his wall.

([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/05/politics/trump-contractors-border-wall-national-emergency/index.html))
