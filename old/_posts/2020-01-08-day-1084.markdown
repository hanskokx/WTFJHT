1/ **Iran launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles at two Iraqi military bases housing U.S. troops Tuesday night in retaliation for the assassination of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani**. No U.S. or Iraqi casualties have been reported. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the strikes a "slap in the face" to the U.S. and not sufficient retaliation for the killing of Soleimani.

We have the most powerful and well equipped military anywhere in the world, by far!" ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/u-s-base-iraq-comes-under-attack-missiles-iran-claims-n1112171))

2/ **The U.S. military had advance warning of Iran's attack on the two American locations in Iraq**. "We had intelligence reports several hours in advance that the Iranians were seeking to strike the bases," a senior administration official said, giving military commanders time to move U.S. troops into safe, fortified positions. Meanwhile, some Trump administration officials believe that Iran's missiles intentionally missed areas populated by Americans, suggesting that Iran chose to send a message rather than provoke a substantial U.S. military response. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-officials-knew-iranian-missiles-were-coming-hours-in-advance/2020/01/08/b6297b4c-3235-11ea-a053-dc6d944ba776_story.html) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/01/08/us-officials-warned-missile-launch-iraq-bases-troops/2842200001/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/08/politics/trump-iran-retaliation-missile-attacks/))

3/ **Trump said Iran appears "to be standing down" after the missile attack** and signaled that no further U.S. military strikes were planned, because "The United States is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it." Trump, in a nationally televised address from the White House, announced a new round of what he termed "punishing economic sanctions" against Iran, while calling on NATO to become "much more involved in the Middle East process." Trump also called on world powers to abandon the 2015 Iran nuclear deal so a new pact could be negotiated.

4/ **The House will vote Thursday on a resolution to limit Trump's military options for action against Iran, unless explicitly authorized by Congress**. The war powers resolution says that without further congressional approval, Trump would have to end all military action against Iran within 30 days. The House could also consider repealing the 2002 authorization for the use of military force for the Iraq War, as well as blocking funding for military action against Iran not approved by Congress. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/us/politics/pelosi-trump-iran.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-08/democrats-debate-how-to-limit-trump-s-options-against-iran) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/08/pelosi-says-house-will-vote-on-trump-iran-war-powers-resolution.html))

* **The House Foreign Affairs Committee called for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to testify in a hearing on Iran next week**. Members of Congress want to know more about the decision to assassinate Iran's top military commander. The hearing will take place on Jan. 14 and will include a panel of Iran policy experts. The State Department has not responded to the request or indicated whether Pompeo will agree to testify. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-security-congress-hearing-idUSKBN1Z62Q6))

5/ **Several Democratic senators want House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to submit the articles of impeachment against Trump to the Senate**, saying the party has little to gain from further delay. Pelosi called on McConnell to publish a resolution outlining rules for the impeachment trial before the House sends over the articles. McConnell, however, declined, saying "There will be no haggling" and that the House had no choice but to end "shameless game-playing" and transmit the two articles of impeachment.

Democrats, however, want the Secret Service to disclose the costs related to Trump's travel and his adult children within 120 days. Mnuchin, however, wants such disclosures to begin next year.
