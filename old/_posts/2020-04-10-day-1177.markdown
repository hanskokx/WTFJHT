* **Editor's note:** I'm apparently not very good at following my own [publishing schedule](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/faq/). WTF Just Happened Today? was *supposed* to be off today for Good Friday (and will be Monday, April 13, in observance of Easter), but here we are. As a result, today's post is short ‚Äì more of a limited/supplemental edition. And, as a reminder, WTFJHT publishes Monday-Friday, except for federal, market holidays, and some random holidays, including Donald Trump‚Äôs birthday. Anyway, have a great, socially distant weekend and remember to wash your damn hands (and to [tip your blogger](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/membership/))!

1/ **The Trump administration continued to push to reopen much of the country by May 1 despite concerns from health experts and economists** of a possible COVID-19 resurgence if Americans return to their normal lives before the coronavirus is under control. At his daily briefing on Thursday, Trump said ‚ÄúHopefully, we‚Äôre going to be opening up ‚Äî you could call it opening ‚Äî very, very, very, very soon, I hope.‚Äù But on Friday, Trump walked that back, saying "we‚Äôre not doing anything until we know this country is going to be healthy," adding "We‚Äôre looking at a date, we hope we‚Äôll be able to fulfill a certain date." CDC guidance on social distancing is set to expire April 30. Trump added that he was creating a new council of doctors and business leaders devoted to "opening our country," which will be separate from the Coronavirus Task Force.

* **\[Opinion\] I‚Äôve read the plans to reopen the economy. They‚Äôre scary**. "Even if you can imagine the herculean political, social, and economic changes necessary to manage our way through this crisis effectively, there is no normal for the foreseeable future. Until there‚Äôs a vaccine, the US either needs economically ruinous levels of social distancing, a digital surveillance state of shocking size and scope, or a mass testing apparatus of even more shocking size and intrusiveness."

* **\[Opinion\] Getting Down to Planning the Next Year and the Interim New Normal**. "Put simply, we won‚Äôt be able to get back to even a semi-normal social and economic life until we have a system in place that will prevent us from rapidly falling right back into a cycle of more outbreaks, lockdowns, deaths in the tens of thousands and economic shocks."

2/ **New projections from the departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services show a spike in coronavirus infections if shelter in place, school closures, and social distancing orders are lifted after 30 days**. The [projections](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6874-fema-coronavirus-projections/1e16b74eea9e302d8825/optimized/full.pdf#page=1), dated April 9, outlined three scenarios: doing nothing to mitigate the spread; a "steady state" where schools remain closed until summer, 25% of Americans work from home, and social distancing continues; and a 30-day shelter in place, on top of those ‚Äústeady state‚Äù restrictions. The report concludes that lifting restrictions after 30 days would result in "a greater rebound peak after the mitigation is relaxed." Trump, meanwhile, called relaxing the restrictions "without question, it‚Äôs the biggest decision I‚Äôve ever had to make."

3/ **Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he is open to reinstating Navy captain who was relieved of his post after asking for help dealing with a coronavirus outbreak aboard his ship**. Esper said his "inclination is always to support the chain of command," but that he has "taken nothing off the table" when it comes to the possibility of reinstating Capt. Brett Cozier. Cozier was relieved after a letter he sent to Esper asking for help with the outbreak was leaked to the media.

* **üìå [Day 1174](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/04/07/day-1174/#2-acting-navy-secretary-thomas-modly): Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly resigned a day after he ridiculed and then apologized to a captain he had ousted for raising concerns about a coronavirus outbreak on the USS Theodore Roosevelt**. Modly, speaking to the ship‚Äôs crew over a loudspeaker, called Capt. Brett Crozier ‚Äútoo naive or too stupid to be the commanding officer of a ship like this," accusing him of a ‚Äúbetrayal of trust.‚Äù Capt. Crozier was relieved of command last week by Modly after writing a letter to senior Navy officials outlining the challenges of trying to contain a coronavirus outbreak aboard the ship and requested that sailors be allowed to quarantine on land. Defense Secretary Mark Esper accepted Modly's resignation and selected Under Secretary of the Army James McPherson to replace Modly as acting Navy secretary.
