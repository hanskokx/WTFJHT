### ‚öñÔ∏è Trump‚Äôs Senate Impeachment Trial:

**What happened today?** The Senate voted to block new new witnesses in Trump's impeachment trial. The 49 to 51 vote ensures the trial will be the first impeachment in U.S. history without witnesses. Two GOP lawmakers ‚Äî Susan Collins and Mitt Romney ‚Äî broke ranks and voted with Democrats on the motion to call new witnesses. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the failed motion "a grand tragedy." Democrats attempted to force four amendments to Mitch McConnell's organizing resolution, which outlines the rules for the rest of the trial. The Senate, however, voted down all four Democratic amendments to allow for the subpoenaing of documents and witnesses. Earlier in the day, Republicans and Trump's legal team argued that new witnesses and documents were unnecessary and would only prolong the trial for weeks or months despite a Democratic proposal to limit depositions to one week. Immediately before the vote, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff warned Republican senators that ‚ÄúThe facts will come out.‚Äù House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, called Republican senators who voted against witnesses and documents are ‚Äúaccomplices to the President‚Äôs cover-up.‚Äù

**What's next?** Closing arguments will be held at 11 a.m. Eastern on Monday and last four hours. Senators are also expected to give speeches on the Senate floor on Tuesday ‚Äì the same day Trump will deliver his State of the Union Address. The Senate will vote at 4 p.m. Wednesday on the two impeachment charges against Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Senate is virtually certain to acquit Trump.

* **LAST NIGHT: Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander said he would vote to dismiss a motion to summon witnesses and call for documents in the Senate impeachment trial**. Alexander acknowledged that it was ‚Äúinappropriate for the president to ask a foreign leader to investigate his political opponent and to withhold United States aid to encourage that investigation,‚Äù but says the Constitution doesn‚Äôt give the Senate the authority to ‚Äúremove the president from office and ban him from this year‚Äôs ballot simply for actions that are inappropriate.‚Äù The announcement means Democrats‚Äô bid to call new witnesses in the trial will likely fall short since Republicans now have the votes to block the motion.

According to Bolton‚Äôs unpublished book, *[The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir](https://amzn.to/36MzMHS)*, Trump instructed Bolton during an Oval Office meeting to call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and encourage him to meet with Rudy Giuliani to discuss the investigations into Trump‚Äôs political opponents. Bolton said he never made the call. Two months later, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate his political opponents. The Oval Office meeting was also attended by Giuliani, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and White House counsel Pat Cipollone, who is now leading Trump's impeachment defense.

Bolton‚Äôs account was included in drafts of a manuscript he circulated to close associates. A draft was also sent to the White House for a standard review process on Dec. 30 ‚Äî 12 days after Trump was impeached. The White House ordered Bolton and other key officials with firsthand knowledge of Trump‚Äôs dealings not to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry.

The former national security adviser submitted his book manuscript nearly a month ago to the White House for review.
