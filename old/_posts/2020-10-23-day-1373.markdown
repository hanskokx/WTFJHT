1/ **The United States coronavirus cases set new a daily record**, topping more than 82,600 cases and breaking the July 16 single-day record. The current surge is already more widespread than the waves this summer and spring. COVID-19 hospitalizations have increased in 38 states over the past week and continue to rise so quickly that some hospitals in the West and Midwest are already running out of hospital beds. A new study forecast that more than 511,000 Americans could die from COVID-19 by February ‚Äì that's more than all the lives lost by the U.S. in World War II. Biden warned that America was headed for a ‚Äúdark winter‚Äù with no COVID-19 vaccine expected to be available for most of people until the middle of next year. Trump, meanwhile, declared that the U.S. is ‚Äúrounding the corner‚Äù and that the pandemic "will soon be gone." \[*Editor's note: Please continue to watch your distance, wear your mask, and wash your damn hands.*\].

* **The FDA approved remdesivir as a treatment for the coronavirus** ‚Äì the first and only fully FDA-approved drug in the U.S. for treating the coronavirus. In May, the FDA granted the antiviral drug for emergency use authorization, allowing doctors to use it on patients hospitalized with COVID-19 even though the medication had not been formally approved.

2/ **Trump almost took responsibility for his administration's failure on COVID-19 during the second and final debate**, saying ‚ÄúI take full responsibility,‚Äù followed immediately by ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my fault that it came here." The coronavirus has killed more than 220,000 people in the United States. At one point during the debate, Trump said Americans were "learning to live with it." To which Biden replied: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre learning to die with it."

3/ **The Trump administration pressured the CDC to support the use of hotels to hold migrant children before deporting them**. A federal judge halted the practice last month, saying the Trump administration had failed to provide a public health reason for keeping minors in hotel rooms, instead of the licensed shelters overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services. CDC officials, however, have declined to affirm the declaration from the HHS that detaining migrant children in hotels is the best way to protect them from the coronavirus. Trump campaign‚Äôs communications director, meanwhile, asserted that the reason 545 migrant children have not been reunited with their families ‚Äì who were separated by the administration ‚Äì is that "the parents do not want the children returned. During the debate, Trump suggested that the separated children were in facilities that ‚Äúwere so clean‚Äù and were well ‚Äútaken care of.‚Äù Biden, however, called the policy of separating families and the inability to track down the parents of the children ‚Äúcriminal.‚Äù ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/10/23/immigrant-minors-hotels-trump/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/23/trump-campaign-spox-claims-parents-of-separated-migrants-dont-want-children-back-431595) / [BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hamedaleaziz/trump-debate-immigrant-children-cages))
