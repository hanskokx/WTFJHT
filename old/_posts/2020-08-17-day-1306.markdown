1/ **Nancy Pelosi recalled the House from summer recess to vote on legislation to block changes at the Postal Service that could disenfranchise voters who use mail-in ballots.** The House was not scheduled to return until Sept. 14, but will vote Saturday on a $25 billion bill to fund the Postal Service and "prohibit the Postal Service from dialing back levels of service it had in place" on Jan. 1 until the pandemic ends. The Postal Service is expected to receive as many as 80 million mail-in ballots cast by Americans who are worried about voting in-person because of the coronavirus. Trump, meanwhile, attacked the Postal Service, declaring that the agency ‚Äúhas been failing for many decades‚Äù and asserting that Democrats ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have a clue."

* **\[Context\] Postal crisis ripples across nation as election looms**.

2/ **Postmaster General Louis DeJoy agreed to testify at an "urgent" hearing before the House Oversight Committee next Monday about changes to the U.S. Postal Service**. Trump, meanwhile, denied that his administration was attempting to slow down the mail or that he's "tampering" with the election, arguing that DeJoy is trying "to make the post office great again," which he claimed is ‚Äúone of the disasters of the world.‚Äù And, speaking to reporters outside the White House, Trump [claimed](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/17/mail-in-voting-trump-postal-service-397009) ‚ÄúI have encouraged everybody to speed up the mail, not slow the mail.‚Äù Trump later [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1295454897689604097) "SAVE THE POST OFFICE!" after [wondering aloud](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1295454264412667904) on Twitter "Why is Congress scheduled to meet \[DeJoy\] during the Republican Convention, rather than now, while the Dems are having their Convention." Last week, Trump admitted that he opposed additional funding for the Postal Service and election security because they would help facilitate voting by mail amid the coronavirus pandemic. On Saturday, Trump [continued](https://www.axios.com/trump-postmaster-general-usps-mail-ballots-dd32964a-ee48-4f62-9f44-f1d213f2b66a.html) his attacks on mail-in voting during a press conference, claiming without evidence that voting by mail will make the U.S. a ‚Äúlaughingstock."

New York is reportedly also considering action. The states are expected to announce the lawsuit early this week. Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said the cohort is working "to determine what Trump and U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy are doing, whether they have already violated or are likely to violate any laws, and what tools we have at our disposal to put a stop to President Trump's ongoing attack on our Postal Service and our democracy."

4/ **Trump suggested that the FDA should approve an untested experimental coronavirus treatment.** Despite no public data or peer-reviewed research showing that the experimental botanical extract, oleandrin, has ever been tested in animals or humans for its efficacy against COVID-19, Trump said the extract should be marketed as a dietary supplement or approved as a drug to cure COVID-19. Oleandrin was promoted to Trump during an Oval Office meeting in July by HUD Secretary Ben Carson and MyPillow.com CEO Mike Lindell ‚Äî a prominent Trump donor who recently took a financial stake in the company that develops the extract.

* **The COVID-19 rate in children have been "steadily increasing" since March**, according to updated CDC guidance. "Recent evidence suggests that children likely have the same or higher viral loads in their nasopharynx compared with adults and that children can spread the virus effectively in households and camp settings," the guidance states. Health experts say children make up more than 7% of all coronavirus cases in the U.S., while comprising about 22% of the country's population.
