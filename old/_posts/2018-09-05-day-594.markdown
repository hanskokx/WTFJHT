1/ **A senior Trump administration official published an anonymous essay in the New York Times claiming cabinet members discussed removing Trump from office early in his presidency "given the instability many witnessed."** The official criticized Trump's "amorality" and reckless decision-making, saying "there is a quiet resistance within the administration of people choosing to put country first" and that "Americans should know that there are adults in the room" who "fully recognize what is happening. And we are trying to do what’s right even when Donald Trump won't." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/05/politics/nyt-trump-resistance-op-ed/index.html))

2/ **Trump called the unsigned op-ed a "disgrace" and "gutless."** Trump attacked the New York Times for publishing an essay by an unnamed administration official who claims the president's advisers deliberately try to block Trump's misguided impulses. The anonymous official wrote that Trump's "impulses are generally anti-trade and anti-democratic." At a White House event, Trump brought up the op-ed, saying "This is what we have to deal with" and that "they don't like Donald Trump and I don't like them." He later demanded that "the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!"

3/ **Sarah Huckabee Sanders called the author of the "resistance" op-ed a "coward"** who should "do the right thing and resign." Sanders accused the author of choosing to "deceive" Trump by remaining in the administration and called on the Times to "issue an apology" for publishing the "pathetic, reckless, and selfish op-ed."

4/ **Trump is "in the worst mood of his presidency"** and frequently calls confidants to "vent about his selection of \[Jeff\] Sessions and \[FBI Director Christopher\] Wray."
