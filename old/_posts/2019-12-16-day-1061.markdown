1/ **The House Judiciary Committee accused Trump of "multiple federal crimes" and argued that Trump "betrayed the nation by abusing his high office."** The 658-page report labels Trump's behavior "both constitutional and criminal in character" and recommends two articles of impeachment: abuse of power for holding up nearly $400 million worth of security aid and a White House meeting until Ukraine agreed to announce investigations into Biden and 2016 election interference, and obstruction of Congress, saying "Trump's obstruction of Congress does not befit the leader of a democratic society. It calls to mind the very claims of royal privilege against which our founders rebelled." The House is expected to vote Wednesday on whether to impeach Trump.
