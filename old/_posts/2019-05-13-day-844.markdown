Two requests by presidential advisers show how far the White House has gone to try to push back on accusations that the president obstructed justice. McGahn initially entertained the request. "We did not perceive it as any kind of threat or something sinister," McGahn's attorney said in a statement. "It was a request, professionally and cordially made."

4/ **China is raising tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods starting on June 1**. The move to impose steeper tariffs on U.S. goods comes in response to Trump's decision to hike tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods.
