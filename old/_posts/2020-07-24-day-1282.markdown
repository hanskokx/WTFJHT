1/ **The CDC published new guidance recommending that schools reopen in the fall ‚Äì two weeks after Trump [criticized](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/07/08/day-1266/#2-the-cdc-will-issue-new-guidance-on) its earlier recommendations on school reopenings as ‚Äúvery tough and expensive."** The new [guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/reopening-schools.html) start with an unsigned statement on "the importance of reopening America's schools this fall," and repeatedly describe children as low risk for being infected by or transmitting the coronavirus. A recent National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [report](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-07-16/will-children-spread-covid-19-if-they-return-to-school), however, concludes that "There is insufficient evidence with which to determine how easily children and youth contract the virus and how contagious they are once they do." Nevertheless, the CDC claimed that "the best available evidence indicates that COVID-19 poses relatively low risks to school-aged children," and that "reopening schools creates opportunity to invest in the education, well-being, and future of one of America‚Äôs greatest assets ‚Äî our children." Earlier this month, an internal CDC document [warned](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/07/13/day-1271/#2-internal-cdc-documents-warned-that) that fully reopening schools would be the ‚Äúhighest risk‚Äù for the spread of coronavirus. Dr. Anthony Fauci said the country should try ‚Äúas best as we possibly can‚Äù to keep children in school, but ‚Äúit depends on where you are" and reopenings should depend on the level of virus transmission in individual communities.

* **Barron Trump's school will not fully reopen in September despite Trump's repeated demands and threats to withhold federal money**. St. Andrew‚Äôs Episcopal School will decided in August whether to adopt a hybrid model for the fall that would allow limited in-person education or to resume holding all classes completely online as was done in the spring.

2/ **Trump canceled the in-person portion of the Republican National Convention as the coronavirus continues to spread across the U.S.** The event was supposed to be held in Jacksonville, FL next month after North Carolina officials said they wanted the party to take health precautions. Trump, however, abruptly announced at a press conference last night that "the timing for this event is not right, just not right with what‚Äôs happened recently." He cited the "flare-up" of coronavirus cases in Florida and said "I have to protect the American people." Trump has repeatedly downplayed and denied the dangers of large gatherings over the last few months and accused Democrats of ‚Äúpurposely‚Äù keeping their states closed for political advantage. Trump said he still plans to give an acceptance speech of some kind, but it won't be done in person.

3/ **Trump said he would deploy as many as 75,000 federal agents into U.S. cities as part of his "surge" against "violent crime."** Trump told Fox News that he would would dispatch "50,000, 60,000 people" into American cities, but eventually upped the number to 75,000. "We'll go into all of the cities, any of the cities. We're ready," he said. Trump first said the federal government would "have to be invited in," but added suggested that a lack of invitation wouldn't prevent him from deploying federal agents. "At some point we'll have to do something much stronger than being invited in," he said. Meanwhile, the Trump administration deployed a Special Response Team, comprised of an unspecified number of Customs and Border Patrol agents, to Seattle to protect federal property.

5/ **Trump repealed a fair housing regulation he claimed would lead to ‚Äúdestruction‚Äù of the country‚Äôs suburbs**. The White House replaced the rule, which required local governments to proactively track patterns of poverty and segregation to gain access to federal housing funds, with a checklist of questions that would allow local governments to essentially self-certify that they are meeting their obligation to ‚Äúaffirmatively further fair housing‚Äù under the 1968 Fair Housing Act.

6/ **China ordered the U.S. to close its consulate in Chengdu.** The move is retaliation after Trump ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, TX.
