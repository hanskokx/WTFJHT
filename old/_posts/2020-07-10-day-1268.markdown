Trump has complained about the coronavirus destroying ‚Äúthe greatest economy,‚Äù which he claims to have personally built, laments the unfair ‚Äúfake news‚Äù media, and he bemoans the ‚Äúsick, twisted‚Äù police officers in Minneapolis, whose killing of an unarmed black man in their custody provoked the nationwide racial justice protests.

2/ **Dr. Anthony Fauci last saw Trump in person at the White House on June 2 and hasn‚Äôt briefed Trump on the coronavirus in at least two months**. Trump, meanwhile, publicly criticized Fauci, telling Fox News' Sean Hannity that the nation‚Äôs top infectious disease experts "has made a lot of mistakes." Earlier this week, Trump said he disagreed with Fauci‚Äôs characterization that new cases could surpass 100,000 a day if the virus continues to spread at its current pace, saying ‚ÄúI think we are in a good place [...] We‚Äôve done a good job [...] I think we are going to be in very good shape.‚Äù ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/10/coronavirus-trumps-rift-with-white-house-health-advisor-fauci-widens-as-cases-hit-new-records.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-says-fauci-made-lot-mistakes-n1233402) / [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/57834c2c-a078-4736-9173-8fb32cfbbf4e))

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has led the administration's effort press the FDA to approve the antimalarial drug. There are 60 million doses of hydroxychloroquine in the Strategic National Stockpile that can‚Äôt be distributed unless the FDA issues an emergency authorization.

4/ **Trump instructed the Treasury Department to review the tax-exempt status of schools and threatened to revoke their funding ‚Äúif this Propaganda or Act Against Public Policy continues.‚Äù** In a series of tweets, Trump accused Democrats of exploiting the pandemic for political gain by refusing to reopen schools and businesses to hurt the economy and his re-election, suggesting in a tweet that too many schools were about ‚ÄúRadical Left Indoctrination, not Education.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúOur children must be Educated, not Indoctrinated!‚Äù Most colleges and universities ‚Äî private and public ‚Äî are registered as tax exempt because of their educational purposes.

Stone was convicted of seven felonies for obstructing the congressional inquiry, lying to investigators under oath, and trying to block the testimony of a witness whose account would have exposed his lies. Stone is set to go to prison next week unless Trump intervenes. When told that Stone was "praying" for a pardon ahead of his deadline to report to prison, Trump said, "If you say he's praying, his prayer may be answered," adding, "Let's see what happens."
