1/ **Trump and Melania tested positive for the coronavirus** months after playing down the pandemic that has killed more than 205,000 Americans and sickened millions more. Trump reportedly has a low-grade fever, nasal congestion, and a cough. He received an infusion of an experimental antibody cocktail and was taken to Walter Reed Medical Center Friday afternoon by helicopter after his condition worsened. He will remain at Walter Reed for a few days. Earlier in the day, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters that Trump had "mild symptoms." Late Thursday night, Trump tweeted: "Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!‚Äú Trump, 74, was diagnosed hours after one of his closest advisers, Hope Hicks, [tested positive](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hope-hicks-president-trumps-closest-advisers-tests-positive/story?id=73377363) Thursday morning. Hicks traveled with Trump on Air Force One and Marine One this week to the presidential debate in Cleveland on Tuesday and to a campaign rally in Minnesota on Wednesday. After the White House learned of Hicks‚Äô symptoms, Trump flew to New Jersey for a fundraiser anyway, delivered a speech, and was in close contact with dozens of other people, including campaign supporters at a roundtable event. At a political dinner Thursday night, Trump told guests that ‚Äúthe end of the pandemic is in sight.‚Äù While he did not appear ill at the time, he did not speak to reporters when he returned to the White House. The president‚Äôs physician, meanwhile, said Trump was ‚Äúwell.‚Äù Hicks is showing symptoms. Three days ago, at the presidential debate, Trump [mocked](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-says-he-wears-masks-when-needed-and-mocks-bidens-masks/) Biden for wearing a mask every time he appeared in public. ‚ÄúI put a mask on when I think I need it,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúEvery time you see him, he‚Äôs got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from it. And he shows up with the biggest mask I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äù The Trump campaign announced that all of Trump's planned events are being postponed or going virtual. Trump also canceled his plans to travel to a rally in Florida. There are 32 days before the election on Nov. 3.

2/ **Trump knew Thursday morning that Hope Hicks tested positive for coronavirus and continued with a full schedule of events anyway**. The White House has not said when Trump first tested positive and it's not known whether Trump was tested Thursday morning, but Trump said late Thursday he was awaiting results.After Trump learned that Hicks was positive Thursday, the White House modified plans for who would travel on Marine One and Air Force One to Trump's fundraiser at his Bedminster golf club. On Monday, Trump claimed "We‚Äôre rounding the corner‚Äù on the pandemic. Trump was joined in the Rose Garden by Mike Pence; Alex Azar, Betsy DeVos, and the chief executive of Abbott Laboratories, Robert Ford. On Tuesday, Trump traveled on Air Force One to Cleveland for the first presidential debate with all of his adult children and senior members of his White House and campaign staff, including Jared Kushner, Trump Jr., Kimberly Guilfoyle, Lara Trump, Jason Miller, Stephen Miller, Mark Meadows, Robert O‚ÄôBrien, and Rep. Jim Jordan. Nobody wore masks while boarding or deplaning. Bill Stepien, Trump's campaign manager, was also seen on board without a mask and was later spotted getting into a staff van with Hicks. On Wednesday, Hicks was isolated in a separate cabin from the rest of the White House staff on Air Force One on the trip home from Wednesday's rally in Minnesota night after falling ill.  Trump left the White House on Thursday at 1 p.m. for the New Jersey fundraiser. Before his own diagnosis was made public, Trump sounded raspy on a call with Iowa voters and in an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News. Republican donors who attended Trump‚Äôs fundraiser at his Bedminster golf club, meanwhile, are reportedly "freaking out" and asking the Trump campaign and GOP officials for guidance on what to do. About 30 to 50 donors came close to Trump at the event.

3/ **Biden and Harris both tested negative for the coronavirus**. Jill Biden and Doug Emhoff also tested negative. "I hope this serves as a reminder," Biden said, "wear a mask, keep social distance, and wash your hands." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, said Trump‚Äôs frequent dismissal of COVID-19 health guidelines ‚Äúwas sort of a brazen invitation for something like this to happen.‚Äù ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/biden-tests-negative-for-covid-19-693cabd6-6837-4ca7-9c22-fb2f51a114ed.html) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/02/joe-biden-covid-test-negative-after-donald-trump-positive-test/5894403002/) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/democratic-nominee-joe-biden-tests-negative-for-coronavirus-after-potential-exposure.html) / [HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pelosi-trump-covid-19_n_5f772c9ec5b66377b28121b6) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/02/politics/joe-biden-coronavirus/index.html))

4/ **The Justice Department and FBI are preparing for Election Day civil unrest**. While the department and the FBI monitors elections every year and engage in ‚Äúextensive election planning,‚Äù including for ‚Äúthe possibility of violence," officials familiar with the matter said the planning is particularly intense this year because of the unrest the country has already seen, and the nature of an election during a pandemic. Trump, meanwhile, has declined to say he'll accept the election results, exaggerated claims about voter fraud, and urged supporters to ‚Äúgo into the polls and watch very carefully.‚Äù ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/fbi-election-poll-watchers/2020/10/02/6d482f48-0414-11eb-a2db-417cddf4816a_story.html))

Earlier in the day, however, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany wouldn't give a declarative statement denouncing White supremacists.

6/ **Melania Trump mocked migrant children separated at the border, saying "give me a fucking break."** In a tape secretly recorded in 2018 by Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former friend and senior adviser to the first lady, Melania complained about being criticized for Trump's policy of separating families who illegally crossed the southern border while at the same time needing to perform traditional first lady duties, such as preparing for Christmas. "They say I'm complicit. I'm the same like him, I support him. I don't say enough I don't do enough where I am," she said. "OK, and then I do it and I say that I'm working on Christmas and planning for the Christmas and they said, 'Oh, what about the children that they were separated?' Give me a fucking break." Earlier in the conversation, the first lady complained about Christmas decorations at the White House, saying "I'm working \[...\] my ass off on the Christmas stuff, that you know, who gives a fuck about the Christmas stuff and decorations?"
