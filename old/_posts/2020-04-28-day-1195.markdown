1/ **Trump announced a new federal coronavirus testing "blueprint" for governors lifting stay-at-home restrictions**. Trump billed the plan as a "phased and very safe reopening" of the U.S. over the next few months, despite the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States crossing 1 million. Republican and Democratic governors, meanwhile, warned of financial calamity if Washington doesn‚Äôt provide relief.

* **Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said states that had poorly managed budgets before coronavirus should not be rescued by the federal government**. Mnuchin said he approves of local governments using coronavirus funding to enforce public safety through law enforcement, but not for revenue lost because of the economic shutdown or ‚Äústates that were mismanaged‚Äù before the pandemic hit. Mitch McConnell, meanwhile, said he is open to providing reeling states and cities with relief, but that he will "insist" Congress limit the liabilities of health care workers, business owners, and employees from lawsuits.

2/ **Trump urged governors to "seriously consider" reopening their public schools before the end of the academic year as part of his push to restart the economy**. Trump told the governors on a conference call to "maybe get going on it" because "young children have done very well in this disaster that we've all gone through" and that "a lot of people are wanting to have school openings." Dozens of states, however, already have said it would be unsafe for students to return until the summer or fall.

When asked if he takes responsibility, Trump said: "No, I don't."
