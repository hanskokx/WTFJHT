1/ **Senior Trump administration officials overturned and granted at least 25 security clearances â€“ including two current senior White House officials â€“ to people who were initially denied** by career employees for "serious disqualifying issues" in their backgrounds. Tricia Newbold, a whistleblower working in the White House Personnel Security Office, told the House Oversight and Reform Committee that she warned her superiors that clearances "were not always adjudicated in the best interest of national security." Oversight Committee chairman Elijah Cummings said he was prepared to authorize subpoenas to compel the White House to comply with an investigation into whether national secrets were at risk. Newbold claims she was retaliated against for declining to issue security clearances, including being suspended without pay for 14 days.

2/ **The House Judiciary Committee plans to vote to authorize subpoenas to obtain Robert Mueller's full report**. Attorney General William Barr pledged to release a redacted version of the report by mid-April. Chairman Jerry Nadler, however, wants the "full and complete report," which spans nearly 400 pages, as well as underlying evidence. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-judiciary-plans-vote-this-week-to-subpoena-muellers-report/2019/04/01/411e24a6-5469-11e9-8ef3-fbd41a2ce4d5_story.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/01/politics/house-judiciary-subpoena-full-muller-report/index.html))

3/ **Trump called the 2020 census "meaningless" if it doesn't include a citizenship question that two federal judges have already ruled against**.

4/ **Trump plans to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign assistance programs for Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador**.
