1/ **Robert Mueller's report is more than 300 pages long and contains "lots and lots of footnotes,"** raising questions about how Attorney General Bill Barr was able to release his four-page summary of "principal conclusions" two days after Mueller turned it in. Democrats have demanded that Barr make the full report and "all of the underlying evidence" public. Nancy Pelosi called Barr's summary "condescending" and "arrogant." The Justice Department, meanwhile, has said it will release a version of the Mueller report in "weeks not months," but sensitive information will not be included. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/us/politics/mueller-report-length.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/28/mueller-report-length-1242017) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-official-says-mueller-report-is-more-than-300-pages-11553786698) / [Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/c53b37110eb94149bf925c660ad16fb4) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/nancy-pelosi-mueller-report-bill-barr-summary-3ba27a36-3ebd-4bff-8885-29ff6ab1792e.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/28/politics/mueller-report-pages/index.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/mueller-s-report-russia-probe-more-300-pages-long-n988426))

2/ **Barr is expected to miss the House Democrats' April 2nd deadline for him to turn in the full Mueller report to Congress.** Democrats are expected to subpoena the Justice Department for the full report if Barr misses the deadline. Barr also suggested that it will likely take weeks to redact the report. House Judiciary Committee chairman, Jerry Nadler, said Barr "wouldn't commit" to releasing the report to Congress without redactions, but did agree to testify to the committee "reasonably soon." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-intelligence-committee-republicans-formally-call-on-schiff-to-resign-as-chairman/2019/03/28/669f431c-515e-11e9-88a1-ed346f0ec94f_story.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-27/barr-agrees-to-testify-on-mueller-report-panel-chairman-says) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/27/mueller-report-barr-wont-commit-to-sharing-full-findings-democrat-says))

3/ **Trump and Republicans in Congress are calling Adam Schiff to resign** after Mueller's report did not conclude that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 election. Trump accused Schiff of having "spent two years knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking" and should therefore "be forced to resign from Congress!" Schiff insists that "undoubtedly there was collusion" and vowed that the House Intelligence Committee will continue to look into the counterintelligence aspects of Mueller's investigation. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/28/trump-adam-schiff-resign-1241405) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia/trump-fellow-republicans-want-house-intelligence-chief-adam-schiff-out-idUSKCN1R917C) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/28/politics/adam-schiff-call-resign-republicans-house-intelligence-committee/index.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-intel-republicans-call-schiff-resign-chairman-after-mueller-report-n988356))

* **Trump accused two former FBI employees of having "committed treason" for investigating possible Russian links to his campaign during the 2016 campaign**. Peter Strzok was fired from the FBI after officials discovered he had been sharing anti-Trump texts with Lisa Page, an FBI lawyer and former member of the Mueller investigation, who he was having an affair with. Trump also promised to release the FISA warrants and related documents used by the FBI to investigate his campaign in full and unredacted in order to "get to the bottom" of how the Russia collusion narrative began. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-28/trump-accuses-fbi-officials-who-investigated-him-of-treason) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/trump-fbi-officials-treason-over-russia-793cb6be-b430-4c65-b41d-4581373a25c2.html) / [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-vows-to-release-fisa-docs-now-that-mueller-probe-is-concluded-slams-treasonous-fbi))

* **A federal judge has ordered that the Justice Department and FBI turnover James Comey's memos in full**. Many of the memos have been released publicly, but some parts remain redacted. Earlier this month, the Justice Department argued that release of other information in the Comey memos could hurt the then-ongoing Mueller investigation. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/28/politics/james-comey-memo-lawsuit/index.html))

* **Jared Kushner met privately with the Senate Intelligence Committee**, which wanted to re-interview witnesses central to the Russia investigation.

* **Russian agent Maria Butina will be sentenced on April 26**. Butina pleaded guilty last year to conspiracy to act as a Russian agent without registering with the Justice Department. She faces a maximum of five years in prison but could receive zero to six months because of a plea deal. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/28/707633211/russian-agent-maria-butina-to-be-sentenced-april-26))

4/ **Trump frequently exaggerated his net worth and hid his debts to lenders and investors**, sometimes sending official-looking documents called "Statements of Financial Condition." Investigators on Capitol Hill and in New York are attempting to determine if Trump's inflated numbers ever crossed over into fraud. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/politics/trump-statements-of-financial-condition/))

5/ **The Department of Homeland Security will ask Congress for the authority to deport unaccompanied migrant children more quickly**. Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen will also propose holding families seeking asylum in detention until their cases are decided and allow immigrants to apply for asylum from their home countries. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/dhs-ask-congress-sweeping-authority-deport-unaccompanied-migrant-children-n988651))

* **Trump – again – threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border because he says Mexico and several Central American countries are not doing enough to stem the flow of migrants coming to the United States.** Trump singled out Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador in particular for having "taken our money for years" but not doing anything about migration. Trump continued that "Mexico is doing NOTHING to help stop the flow of illegal immigrants to our Country." ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/28/trump-mexico-border-migrant-surge-1241307) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-renews-threat-to-close-the-southern-border-blasts-mexico-on-immigration/2019/03/28/92530508-5144-11e9-88a1-ed346f0ec94f_story.html))
