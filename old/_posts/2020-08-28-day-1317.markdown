1/ **Trump's effort to block a subpoena for his financial records would "significantly impair" an ongoing investigation into potential financial crimes**, according to the Manhattan district attorney. Cyrus Vance urged the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reject Trump's emergency bid to block the subpoena for eight years of his tax returns, saying the "continued delay of the grand jury‚Äôs investigation is unwarranted" because Trump has ‚Äúno chance of success.‚Äù Trump has until Monday to respond in writing. Oral arguments are scheduled for Sept. 1. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-subpoena/trump-must-turn-over-tax-returns-does-not-deserve-immunity-manhattans-top-prosecutor-says-idUSKBN25N2YZ) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/27/trump-subpoena-block-cyrus-vance-403867))

2/ **A federal judge ordered the Trump administration and the U.S. Postal Service to turn over documents and information about USPS service changes that could undermine mail-in voting.** U.S. District Judge Stanley Bastian gave the administration 10 days to comply with the order, which is tied to a lawsuit brought by 20 states over the changes made by Postmaster General Louis Dejoy. The Justice Department opposed the request, arguing that responding to the requests would be burdensome and that much of the information is already part of the public record. Among the information sought by the states is a list of all mail sorting machines identified for decommissioning, including their locations, and whether they will be reinstalled if they have already been decommissioned.

* **A judge ordered an Iowa county to invalidate 50,000 requests for absentee ballots**, agreeing with Trump's campaign that its elections commissioner overstepped his authority by pre-filling them with voters' personal information.

3/ **Trump "profoundly" accepted the Republican Party‚Äôs nomination for a second term, botching the word ‚Äúproudly‚Äù in his prepared text**, during a 70-minute speech on the South Lawn of the White House. Trump repeatedly misrepresented his own record and leveled numerous false or misleading attacks on Democrats, asserting that he is responsible for everything good that has happened since taking office and that everyone else is to blame for the country's problems. Trump, meanwhile, has presided over the deaths of 180,000 Americans with nearly 30 million people out of work from the coronavirus, and civil unrest over racial injustice that he has repeatedly and consistently stoked. And, [nearly every claim](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/08/28/nearly-every-claim-trump-made-about-bidens-positions-was-false/) Trump made about Biden‚Äôs positions was false. Trump, nevertheless, claimed the nation is on the cusp of a takeover by "violent anarchists" who would exploit a "weak" Joe Biden to destroy America, adding:¬†‚ÄúNo one will be safe in Biden‚Äôs America.‚Äù Nearly 2,000 guests on the lawn were packed into rows of chairs with few wearing masks despite the pandemic and social distancing guideline.

* **üëë Portrait of a president**: Instead of Evolving as President, Trump Has Bent the Job to His Will. When asked to define what his second-term agenda would be, Trump replied: ‚ÄúBut so I think, I think it would be, I think it would be very, very, I think we‚Äôd have a very, very solid, we would continue what we‚Äôre doing, we‚Äôd solidify what we‚Äôve done, and we have other things on our plate that we want to get done.‚Äù ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/us/politics/donald-trump.html))

4/ **A senior White House official dismissed concerns about the lack of social distancing at Trump's GOP acceptance speech, saying ‚Äúeverybody is going to catch this thing eventually.‚Äù** An estimated 1,500 people, mostly maskless, attended the speech.

5/ **Thousands of demonstrators marched on Washington demanding an end to systemic racism** while honoring the 57th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.‚Äôs ‚ÄúI Have a Dream‚Äù address. Speakers called for the Senate to take up the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which would make it easier to prosecute police officers for misconduct, and enact a new version of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The ‚ÄúGet Your Knee Off Our Necks‚Äù Commitment March convened hours after Trump‚Äôs acceptance speech on the South Lawn of the White House where he railed against what he called agitators bent on destroying ‚Äúthe American way of life."

6/ **FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn removed the agency‚Äôs chief spokeswoman**, who was installed by the White House 11 days ago. Emily Miller previously worked in communications for the re-election campaign of Ted Cruz and was a journalist for One America News, the conservative cable network. Separately, the Department of Health and Human Services terminated the contract of a public relations consultant who had advised Hahn to correct misleading comments about the benefits of blood plasma for COVID-19. HHS, however, denied that Wayne Pines‚Äôs contract was terminated because of his involvement in the plasma messaging.

1. **The House Foreign Affairs Committee announced contempt proceedings against Secretary of State Mike Pompeo** over his ‚Äúongoing refusal to comply‚Äù with a subpoena for records related to the State Department's involvement in attempts to link Joe Biden to corruption in Ukraine. In a statement, Chairman Eliot Engel cited Pompeo‚Äôs ‚Äúunprecedented record of obstruction and defiance of the House‚Äôs constitutional oversight authority.‚Äù ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/28/house-democrats-announce-contempt-proceedings-against-mike-pompeo.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/house-foreign-affairs-mike-pompeo-contempt-biden-1039a46e-57e3-4661-8d45-fe529eef589a.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/28/us/trump-vs-biden#the-house-foreign-affairs-committee-seeks-to-hold-pompeo-in-contempt-of-congress))

2. **Twitter removed two fake, pro-Trump accounts that had co-opted the identities of African Americans**. The fake accounts used the images of Black men for their profile pictures and had five separate tweets with at least 10,000 retweets related to abandoning the Democratic Party. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/viral-pro-trump-tweets-came-fake-african-american-spam-accounts-n1238553))

3. **The Pentagon will reduce the U.S. force in Iraq to about 3,500 troops from about 5,200**. "The U.S. and Iraq refrained from publicly setting a schedule for reducing the approximately 5,200 American troops now in the country when Iraq‚Äôs prime minister visited Washington last week."

4. **University of Pennsylvania faculty asked the provost to investigate how Trump was admitted to the school in 1966**.
   Eric Orts and five other faculty cited "new evidence" on secretly recorded tapes between Mary Trump and Maryanne Trump Barry, in which Trump‚Äôs sister says a friend took his entrance exam. Mary Trump's new book also alleges that Trump paid someone to take his SATs. In July, the six professors wrote that ‚Äúfailing to investigate an allegation of fraud at such a level broadcasts to prospective students and the world at large that the playing field is not equal, that our degrees can be bought, and that subsequent fame, wealth, and political status will excuse past misconduct.‚Äù ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-secret-recordings-sat-penn/2020/08/27/ea7a6640-e892-11ea-a414-8422fa3e4116_story.html))
