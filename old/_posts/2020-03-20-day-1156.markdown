1/ **Senate Republican and Democratic negotiators, as well as senior Trump administration officials kicked off talks on a $1 trillion economic stabilization plan** ‚Äì¬†the third stimulus package Congress has considered this month to confront the coronavirus ‚Äì  with the goal of having a deal by the end of the day. Mitch McConnell has promised to pass the new stimulus though the chamber by Monday despite multiple disagreements over the structure of the bill, which was released Thursday. The initial plan would have given many Americans $1,200 in a one-time payment, but those without federal tax liability ‚Äì i.e. the poorest Americans ‚Äì would get as little as $600. Trump has also promised that the initial payment would be substantially higher than $1,000.

* **üìå [Day 1155](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/03/19/day-1155/#1-the-chairman-of-the-senate-intelli): The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee warned constituents three weeks ago to prepare for dire economic and societal effects from the coronavirus**. "There's one thing that I can tell you about this: It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history," Sen. Richard Burr said on Feb. 27, according to a secret recording of the remarks. "It is probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic." On that same day, Trump suggested that the virus is "going to disappear. One day, it's like a miracle. It will disappear," before adding, "it could get worse before it gets better. It could maybe go away. We'll see what happens." On Feb 13., Burr sold off between $582,029 and $1.56 million of his holdings despite reassuring the public at the time that the government had the coronavirus outbreak under control.
