1/ **The number of confirmed U.S. coronavirus deaths is "a substantial undercount" of the true tally**, according to researchers at Yale University. Researchers found that the 781,000 total deaths in the U.S. from March 1 through May 30 were about 19% higher than what would normally be expected. And, the number of excess deaths from any cause were 28% higher than the official tally of U.S. COVID-19 deaths during those months. In 45 states, seven-day averages of new infections are higher than they were a week ago and more than 800,000 new cases were reported in the U.S. in June ‚Äî led by Florida, Arizona, Texas and California. The World Health Organization, meanwhile, warned that some countries might have to reimplement lockdowns to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

White House officials, however, were first informed in early 2019 of intelligence reports that Russia was offering bounties to kill U.S. and coalition military personnel. Officials also provided Trump with a written briefing of the finding in late February. Trump has also repeatedly dismissed the credibility of the intelligence and White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has [acknowledged](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/01/only-people-who-are-dismissing-russia-bounties-intel-taliban-russia-trump/) the existence of the intelligence, but said there was ‚Äúno consensus‚Äù and that it hadn‚Äôt been completely ‚Äúverified.‚Äù In an additional tweet, Trump claimed that ‚Äúthis is all a made up Fake News Media Hoax started to slander me & the Republican Party.‚Äù ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/505379-trump-dismisses-russian-bounty-allegations-as-a-hoax) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/01/885909588/trump-calls-bounty-report-a-hoax-despite-administration-s-briefing-of-congress) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-decries-russian-bounty-reports-as-fake-news-as-his-national-security-adviser-says-response-options-were-prepared/2020/07/01/91b26732-bb93-11ea-bdaf-a129f921026f_story.html))

6/ **Trump called New York City‚Äôs decision to paint "Black Lives Matter" on Fifth Avenue a "symbol of hate"** that would ‚Äúdenigrate‚Äù the "luxury" street outside Trump Tower and "further antagonize" police.

De Blasio responded to Trump‚Äôs tweets, calling them ‚Äúthe definition of racism.‚Äù ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/07/01/885944289/trump-painting-black-lives-matter-on-5th-avenue-would-be-symbol-of-hate) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/01/trump-black-lives-matter-347051) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/trump-black-lives-matter-hate-af77f4a9-b666-40d2-b4e4-ef23c61088ca.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-painting-black-lives-matter-on-new-yorks-fifth-avenue-would-be-a-symbol-of-hate/2020/07/01/6a039f12-bba2-11ea-bdaf-a129f921026f_story.html))

While most Republican senators said they had no problem with Sen. Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs amendment, Trump tweeted that he would veto it "if the Elizabeth ‚ÄòPocahontas‚Äô Warren (of all people!) Amendment, which will lead to the renaming (plus other bad things!) \[...\] is in the Bill!"

8/ **A federal judge overturned the Trump administration's 2019 policy that prohibited immigrants from claiming asylum in the U.S. if they didn't attempt to first apply for asylum in a country they passed through on the way to the U.S. border.** U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly ruled that the so-called "third-country asylum rule" violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, that the administration ‚Äúunlawfully promulgated‚Äù the rule, failed to show it was in the public interest and didn't abide by the Administrative Procedure Act when adopting the policy. The INA allows anyone who has made it to U.S. soil to apply for asylum, with some exceptions, and the APA requires that Americans be given enough time and opportunity to weigh in on certain rule changes. It's the second time a lower court has concluded the rule is unlawful. Judge Kelly was appointed to the federal bench by Trump in 2017.
