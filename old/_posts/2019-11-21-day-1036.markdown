1/ **The former White House adviser on Russia opened her testimony before the impeachment inquiry by accusing Republican lawmakers of weaponizing "falsehoods" with the "fictional narrative" that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential election**. Fiona Hill called Rep. Devin Nunes attempts to sow doubt that Russia interfered in the election a myth "perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services." She added that it's "beyond dispute" that "Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions" in 2016. Hill and foreign service officer David Holmes appeared together as public impeachment witnesses, testifying about efforts by Gordon Sondland and Rudy Giuliani to convince Ukraine's president to announce investigations that would benefit Trump politically around the time Trump froze security aid to Ukraine. Hill testified that she warned Sondland at the time that his efforts in Ukraine on behalf of Trump would "blow up." She added: "And here we are."

* **MORE**:

* **Hill said Sondland was "involved in a domestic political errand"** and that he was "carrying out what he thought he had been instructed to carry out." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/politics/impeachment-hearings-day-five.html))

* **Holmes testified that Russian intelligence was trying to "drive a wedge" between the U.S. and Ukraine to give the Kremlin more influence in the region**. Hill added that Russia's interest "is to delegitimize the president," and that Russia's goal in 2016 was to put the next president – Trump or Clinton – "under a cloud."

* **Holmes explained that he was able to overhear Trump ask Gordon Sondland about getting Ukraine to launch an investigation, because Trump's voice was "quite loud" and "quite distinctive."** Holmes said that when Trump came on the line, Sondland "sort of winced" and "held the phone away from his ear."

2/ **The deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia testified that Ukrainian officials asked her staff about the military aid on July 25**  – the same day as Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Laura Cooper said Ukrainian officials were aware "there was some kind of issue" with the aid on July 25. Cooper testified that the military aid was critically important and that she had no idea why it was held up, despite Congress authorizing the money and the Defense Department having assured that Ukraine had met the qualifications for receiving it in May. Trump, White House officials, and Republican members of Congress, however, have argued that Kiev wasn't aware of the delay until it was publicly reported in late August, insisting that there could be no wrongdoing if the Ukrainians weren't aware the aid was being held up.

3/ **White House officials and Senate Republicans agreed that a full trial should be conducted if the House impeaches Trump**. The White House reportedly wants Trump's GOP allies in the Senate to hold a trial, but limit it to about two weeks as a way of showing a commitment to due process. Three Republicans, however, can block any impeachment vote on the Senate floor. Trump, meanwhile, is reportedly "miserable" about the ongoing impeachment inquiry and has pushed to dismiss the proceedings outright. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/21/white-house-backs-full-senate-trial-if-house-impeaches-trump-072578) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-and-republicans-discuss-limiting-impeachment-trial-to-two-weeks/2019/11/21/3e02edf8-0c9a-11ea-a49f-9066f51640f6_story.html))

**⚡️ Public Impeachment Hearing Recap:** More than a dozen witnesses have testified publicly before the House Intelligence Committee. No other witnesses are scheduled to testify and the committee will now write a report documenting its findings. The report will be sent to the Judiciary Committee, which is in charge of drafting and voting on articles of impeachment. A Judiciary Committee vote on impeachment would be followed by a vote in the full House vote to send the matter to the Senate for a trial, where it would require a two-thirds majority vote to remove Trump from office.
