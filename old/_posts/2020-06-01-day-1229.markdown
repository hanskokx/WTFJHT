1/ **After a weekend out of sight, Trump emerged from the White House bunker and called America's governors "weak" and demanded that they "dominate" the protesters, which he labeled ‚Äúterrorists.‚Äù** Trump asked ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you prosecuting them?‚Äù while demanding ‚Äúretribution." He warned governors that they‚Äôd look like ‚Äúa bunch of jerks‚Äù if they didn‚Äôt send the protesters to ‚Äújail for long periods of time." Otherwise, Trump added, "you're wasting your time." Trump, who has not formally addressed the nation since the protests began, continued: ‚Äúyou have to use the military \[...\] we have a wonderful military,‚Äù adding that they would look like "fools" if they didn't take control of the situation. Trump also accused Minnesota of becoming ‚Äúa laughingstock all over the world.‚Äù ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/us/politics/trump-protests-george-floyd.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-governors-george-floyd-protests/2020/06/01/430a6226-a421-11ea-b619-3f9133bbb482_story.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/01/politics/donald-trump-race-police/index.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-pushes-governors-to-get-tough-on-violent-protesters-11591026977) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-weak-governors-dominate-civil-unrest-george-floyd-death-protest/))

* **Trump blamed the ‚ÄúLamestream Media‚Äù for the protests**, calling journalists ‚Äútruly bad people with a sick agenda‚Äù after they were [repeatedly](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/05/31/day-1228/#1-police-nationwide-responded-to-pro) targeted by police nationwide last weekend with pepper spray, tear gas, rubber bullets, and excessive use of force. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/business/media/reporters-protests-george-floyd.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage))

2/ **On Friday, Trump took shelter inside an underground bunker for nearly an hour** as protests continued outside the White House and across Washington, D.C. Trump was abruptly taken by Secret Service agents inside the Presidential Emergency Operations Center, an underground bunker that is used to shelter presidents during threatening situations, like terrorist attacks. Trump and his family have reportedly been "shaken" by the experience and the size of the protests.

3/ **The White House turned off almost all the exterior lights Sunday night as more than 1,000 people gathered to protest outside of its gates**. It is unclear why the Trump administration decided to do so, but the White House insisted that there was "nothing new" about the lights-out incident, saying "lights go out at about 11 p.m. almost every night." In normal times, however, the lights are only ever turned off when a president dies. Trump, meanwhile, from safely inside the White House had nothing to say other than to tweet for mayors and governors to ‚Äúget tough‚Äù and that ‚ÄúThe World is watching and laughing at you and Sleepy Joe.‚Äù ([Vox](https://www.vox.com/2020/6/1/21276676/white-house-dark-george-floyd-protests) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/fires-light-up-washington-dc-on-third-night-of-george-floyd-protests) /[New York Magazine](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/06/at-the-white-house-the-lights-were-off.html) / [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/white-house-lights-out-same-time-every-night-criticism-protests-1507901) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-cities-burned-trump-stayed-silent--other-than-tweeting-fuel-on-the-fire/2020/05/31/4fc8761a-a354-11ea-b619-3f9133bbb482_story.html) / [Slate](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/06/white-house-dark-washington-dc-protests.html))

4/ **Trump tweeted that the U.S. would designate a group of anti-fascism activists as a terror organization, despite lacking the legal authority**. Trump, his top officials, Attorney General William Barr, and national security adviser Robert O‚ÄôBrien have all blamed antifa for the violent protests across the country. Antifa, however, is not an organization and does not have a leader, membership roles or any defined, centralized structure. Further, if antifa were a real organization, current law only permits the State Department to designate foreign organizations as terrorist groups. The U.S. does not have domestic terrorism statute.

1. **Trump will postpone next month's G-7 summit at the White House after German Chancellor Angela Merkel declined his invitation to attend**, citing the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Trump responded by telling reporters on Air Force One that he feels the group is ‚Äúvery outdated‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt properly represent ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs going on in the world. He said he plans to invite Russia, Australia, South Korea, and India. Russia was ejected from the group ‚Äî previously the G8 ‚Äî after its annexation of Crimea in 2014.

3. **Transcripts show that Michael Flynn told Russia‚Äôs ambassador to Washington in late 2016 to take ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù actions in response to Obama administration sanctions for election interference**, rather than escalating the situation into a ‚Äútit for tat.‚Äù ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/29/trump-flynn-russia-ambassador-289905))

4. **The top lawyer for the FBI was forced to resign by the Justice Department following criticism by Fox News for his role in the investigation of Michael Flynn**. Dana Boente was asked to step down by senior officials at the DOJ. Boente was the one who signed off on a warrant in 2017 authorizing the FBI to conduct surveillance on Flynn. He also signed one of the reauthorizations to surveil Trump campaign associate Carter Page. Several of Trump's supporters have recently gone on Fox News and other conservative media outlets to criticize Boente's brief role in the Russia probe. Boente spent nearly 40 years at the FBI as its general counsel and a former acting attorney general.
