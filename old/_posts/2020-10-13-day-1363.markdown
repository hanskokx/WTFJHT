1/ **Trump tested negative for the coronavirus ‚Äúon consecutive days,‚Äù** White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said. Conley‚Äôs memo did not specify on which consecutive days Trump had tested negative. Trump was tested using an antigen test, which are considered to be less accurate than molecular tests. Conley added: Trump is "not infectious to others." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/12/politics/trump-health-coronavirus/index.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-12/trump-tests-negative-for-virus-isn-t-infectious-doctor-says?sref=MIBMEEoj) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/12/trump-tests-negative-for-the-coronavirus-on-consecutive-days-white-house-doctor-says.html))

* **Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine trial was paused because of an unexplained illness in one of the volunteers**.

2/ **Trump, eager to prove he's healthy despite his recent COVID-19 hospitalization, returned to the campaign trail on Monday night in Florida** and kicking off four straight days of rallies. While claiming himself cured of COVID-19, Trump asserted he is "immune" to the coronavirus ‚Äì there is no conclusive scientific backing for the claim. ‚ÄúI feel so powerful,‚Äù Trump said before leaving Washington. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll kiss everyone in that audience. I‚Äôll kiss the guys and the beautiful women. Just give you a big fat kiss.‚Äù ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/us/politics/trump-rally-florida.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/trump-returns-trail-claiming-coronavirus-victory-playing-campaign-defense-n1242987) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/12/trump-holds-sanford-florida-rally-first-since-covid-19-diagnosis/5966416002/))

3/ **Mitch McConnell announced that the Senate's "first order of business" when it returns on Oct. 19 will be to vote on a "targeted" coronavirus relief bill, including new funding for the small business Paycheck Protection Program**. House Democrats, Senate Republicans, and the Trump administration, however, are still far apart on a deal. Over the weekend, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin offered House Speaker Nancy Pelosi a roughly $1.8 trillion deal ‚Äî about $400 billion less than the bill House Democrats passed earlier this month. Pelosi dismissed the proposal, and suggested that Trump ‚Äúonly wants his name on a check to go out before Election Day and for the \[stock\] market to go up.‚Äù Nancy Pelosi also told House Democrats that McConnell‚Äôs proposal was a nonstarter. Trump, meanwhile, tweeted for Congress to "Go big or go home!!!‚Äù on a "STIMULUS!" deal.

4/ **Amy Coney Barrett largely refused to answer questions about how she might rule on a challenge to the Affordable Care Act, if she would recuse herself from any lawsuit about the presidential election, and whether she would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade** on the second day of confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. When asked how she would rule if she gets on the court in time to hear a Republican challenge to the Affordable Care Act, Barrett insisted that she‚Äôs ‚Äúnot here on a mission to destroy the Affordable Care Act‚Äù and that she's "not hostile to the ACA." Barrett told the committee that she doesn't have a judicial "agenda" on abortion while declining to answer if she believes that Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided and can be overturned. In 2006, however, Barrett signed an open letter calling Roe v. Wade "barbaric" and "an exercise of raw judicial power." Barrett also declared that she would not ‚Äúallow myself to be used as a pawn to decide this election for the American people.‚Äù She declined, however, to say whether she would recuse herself from any election-related cases.

5/ **Trump continued his public criticism of Dr. Anthony Fauci, tweeting that Fauci's pitching arm is "far more accurate than his prognostications"** ‚Äì a reference to the nation‚Äôs top infectious disease expert poor first pitch at Nationals Park. Trump's criticism comes after Dr. Fauci balked at the Trump campaign including him in a political ad that made it look like he was endorsing Trump. Dr. Fauci said in a statement that "the comments attributed to me without my permission in the GOP campaign ad were taken out of context from a broad statement I made months ago about the efforts of federal public health officials." Dr. Fauci also demanded that the Trump campaign refrain from using him in future campaign ads, saying it would be ‚Äúoutrageous‚Äù and ‚Äúterrible‚Äù if he was featured in another commercial and it could ‚Äúcome back to backfire‚Äù on the campaign. Dr. Fauci, however, said "I'm not going to walk away from this outbreak, no matter who's the president."

 7. **A federal appeals court upheld Texas Gov. Greg Abbott‚Äôs order that limited counties to one mail-in ballot drop-off location**.
