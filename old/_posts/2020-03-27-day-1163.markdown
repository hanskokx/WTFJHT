1/ **The House passed the $2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package and Trump signed it into law**. The legislation will deliver one-time direct payments of $1,200 to most taxpayers and enhance unemployment benefits. The measure also creates a $500 billion lending program for businesses, cities and states, and a $367 billion fund for small businesses. The package was approved by voice vote after a Republican lawmaker attempted to delay the approval and force lawmakers to return to Washington in order to assemble the 216 members needed for a quorum. Trump attacked Rep. Thomas Massie in a series of tweets, calling him a ‚Äúthird rate grandstander‚Äù and suggesting that Republican leaders "throw" him out of the party. The size of the stimulus package, along with Federal Reserve actions, will amount to an injection of about $6 trillion into the economy ‚Äì or about 30% of annual gross domestic product. "We got hit by the invisible enemy and we got hit hard," Trump said before signing the bill. "I think we are going to have a tremendous rebound."

2/ **Trump ordered General Motors to produce 40,000 ventilators under the Defense Production Act hours after criticizing the company on Twitter** for not acting quickly enough to produce supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. Trump said "GM was wasting time. Today‚Äôs action will help ensure the quick production of ventilators that will save American lives." Earlier in the day, Trump tweeted that ‚ÄúGeneral Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!! FORD, GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!!‚Äù The White House also canceled an announcement planned for next week on a joint venture between General Motors and Ventec Life Systems to build as many as 80,000 ventilators. FEMA said it needed more time to assess whether the estimated cost of more than $1 billion was too expensive. GM and Ventec Life said they were ready to ramp up production, but were waiting on the Trump administration to provide clarity about how many ventilators were needed and who would be paid to build them.

* **Trump to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo: "I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators."** Trump, speaking to Sean Hannity on Fox News, was responding to Cuomo's projections that the state will need up to 30,000 ventilators within the next two weeks to adequately respond to the peak of coronavirus cases that are expected to hit the state. "You go into major hospitals sometimes, and they‚Äôll have two ventilators," Trump continued. "And now all of a sudden they‚Äôre saying, 'Can we order 30,000 ventilators?'" Trump's comments come as some New York City hospitals have been forced to start sharing ventilators between as many as four patients at once. As of Friday, 44,635 cases had been confirmed in the state, resulting in 519 deaths. New York state hospitals have 4,000 ventilators in the system.

Gretchen Whitmer of not doing enough to address the health crisis**. ‚ÄúHe shouldn‚Äôt be relying on the federal government.

* **Gov. Andrew Cuomo called on Trump to approve the construction of 4,000 additional hospital beds in New York City**.

Over half." More than 8 million people live in New York City.

3/ **Trump notified U.S. governors that his administration will be issuing new guidelines about "maintaining, increasing or relaxing social distancing and other mitigation measures."**  Mike Pence and a small group of public health officials are expected to brief Trump on his options this weekend about whether to extend the White House's 15-day social distancing guidelines or loosen them for some or all parts of the country. In his letter to governors, Trump said the guidance will contain instructions for classifying certain counties as "high risk, medium risk or low risk," as well as data that will drive the "next phase" of the government's response. Trump floated re-opening the country by Easter, saying he'd like to have the "country opened up and just raring to go" by the April 12 holiday. Since then, however, White House officials have backed away from that date.

The GOP convention is scheduled for Aug. 24-27, roughly two months before the November general election.
