### ‚öñÔ∏è Trump‚Äôs Senate Impeachment Trial:

**What happened today?** Trump's legal team concluded its oral arguments after less than two hours in the chamber with White House counsel Pat Cipollone calling on the Senate to ‚Äúend the era of impeachment‚Äù by declaring Trump not guilty. The White House team reiterated their arguments that the allegations by the House ‚Äî that Trump abused his power in his dealings with Ukraine and obstructed Congress' investigation into his actions ‚Äî don't rise to the level of impeachable offenses. Trump attorney Jay Sekulow claimed that the revelations from John Bolton‚Äôs manuscript ‚Äì that Trump tied the withholding of military aid to Ukraine to investigations into his political rivals ‚Äì were "inadmissible" and that ‚Äú\[Impeachment\] is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts.‚Äù Rep. Adam Schiff, the House‚Äôs lead impeachment manager, suggested that Trump‚Äôs own lawyers made an "effective" case for why the Senate should call Bolton as a witness. And, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump's lawyers "showed how weak their case was" and that "Their whole argument is diversion."

**What's next?** The Senate will return Wednesday for eight hours of question-and-answers followed by another eight hours on Thursday. A vote on whether to hear witnesses is expected on Friday.

1/ **John Bolton told Attorney General William Barr last year that he had concerns that Trump was granting personal favors to the autocratic leaders of Turkey and China**, according to Bolton's [unpublished manuscript](https://amzn.to/36A85S8). Barr responded by saying he was also concerned that Trump had "created the appearance that he had undue influence over what would typically be independent inquiries," pointing to a pair of Justice Department investigations into Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE and Halkbank, Turkey‚Äôs second-largest state-owned bank. The former national security adviser submitted his book manuscript nearly a month ago to the White House for review. A Justice Department‚Äôs spokeswoman, meanwhile, said ‚ÄúThere was no discussion of ‚Äòpersonal favors‚Äô or ‚Äòundue influence‚Äô on investigations, nor did Attorney General Barr state that the President‚Äôs conversations with foreign leaders was improper."

Bolton‚Äôs account was included in drafts of a manuscript he circulated to close associates. A draft was also sent to the White House for a standard review process on Dec. 30 ‚Äî 12 days after Trump was impeached.
