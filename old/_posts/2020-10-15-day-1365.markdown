1/ **Another 898,000 workers filed for unemployment benefits last week**. After declining from a peak of about 7 million in March, claims jumped to the highest since August. The unemployment rate stands at 7.9% ‚Äì more than double its pre-pandemic level. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/15/weekly-jobless-claims.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-15/u-s-jobless-claims-jump-americans-move-to-extended-programs?srnd=premium&sref=MIBMEEoj) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-coronavirus-10-15-2020-11602714104?mod=hp_lead_pos2))

2/ **Mitch McConnell won't bring the White House's proposed $1.8 trillion coronavirus stimulus package to the Senate floor**. Trump, meanwhile, called for even more stimulus spending, saying "I would go higher" while complaining that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin "hasn‚Äôt come home with the bacon." House Democrats, however, are seeking $2.2 trillion, calling the White House‚Äôs latest proposal insufficient.

* **The Transportation Department will use a presidential memo calling for punishing ‚Äúanarchist jurisdictions‚Äù when deciding which cities should get pandemic safety grants**. The Trump administration has deemed Seattle, Portland, and New York City to be ‚Äúpermitting anarchy‚Äù for their handling of protests in response to the killing of George Floyd, racial injustice, and Trump administration policies. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2020/10/15/anarchist-jurisdictions-denied-covid-grant-money/))

3/ **Trump's aides privately warned Republican party donors in February about the potential impact of the coronavirus at a time when Trump was publicly insisting that the virus was ‚Äúvery much under control‚Äù in the United States**. On Feb. 24, senior members of Trump's economic team briefed board members of the Hoover Institution about the outbreaking, saying they weren't able to estimate the consequences of the virus on the American economy. The next day, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, told board members that the coronavirus virus was ‚Äúcontained in the U.S., to date, but now we just don‚Äôt know." Hours earlier, Kudlow told CNBC that the virus was contained and ‚Äúit‚Äôs pretty close to airtight.‚Äù Investors who were briefed on the Hoover meetings said that parts of the readout informed their trades.

* **The number of new coronavirus cases in the U.S. are surging again** with several Midwestern states reporting elevated levels of infections in recent days.

* **The White House has taken a more hands-on role in shaping recommendations from the CDC than previously reported**. "White House advisers have made line-by-line edits to official health guidance, altering language written by CDC scientists on church choirs, social distancing in bars and restaurants as well as internal summaries of public-health reports, according to interviews with current and former agency and administration officials and their emails."

4/ **The U.S. Postal Service agreed to reverse changes that slowed mail service nationwide**. The suit, filed against Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and USPS, was brought by Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and argued that changes implemented in June harmed access to mail services in the state, resulting in delayed delivery of prescriptions, payments, job applications, and impeded the ability of residents to vote by mail. The postal service agreed to reverse all changes.

5/ **The Senate Judiciary Committee will formally vote on Judge Amy Coney Barrett‚Äôs nomination to the Supreme Court on Oct. 22 at 1 p.m. Eastern time**. The full Senate will begin debate on Oct. 23. Mitch McConnell, meanwhile, told reporters: ‚ÄúWe have the votes.‚Äù Republicans can confirm Barrett with a simple majority because the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees was eliminated, and at least 51 GOP senators have already signaled their support for Barrett. On the fourth day of Barrett's confirmation hearings, Democrats tried to indefinitely delay proceedings, arguing that millions of Americans have already voted for the next president and that there's never been a Supreme Court justice nominated and confirmed this close to an election. The Senate has taken half the average time to consider Barrett's nomination.

6/ **Trump and Joe Biden will face off tonight in dueling town halls on different networks at the same time**. Tonight was supposed to be the day of the second presidential debate, but Trump refused to participate when the Commission for Presidential Debates said it would be hosted virtually because of his COVID-19 diagnosis. After the Trump backed out of the second debate, the commission canceled the debate altogether. ABC, meanwhile, scheduled a town hall with Biden shortly after. On Wednesday, NBC announced that agreed to air a town hall with Trump at the same time that Biden will appear on ABC. Both town halls will start at 8 p.m. ET. Biden‚Äôs will last for an hour and a half, while Trump‚Äôs will last for an hour. \[*Editor's note: What a mess.*\] ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/abc-news-announces-town-hall-democratic-nominee-joe/story?id=73506593) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/nbc-news-host-town-hall-trump-thursday-n1243300) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/us/elections/trump-town-hall-nbc.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/kamala-harris-cancels-campaign-travel-after-aide-flight-crew-member-test-positive-for-coronavirus-11602770915) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/15/trump-town-hall-fury-at-nbc-429639))
