1/ **Nancy Pelosi said the Democratic leadership believes that Trump is "engaged in a cover-up"** after meeting with congressional committee leaders. "We believe that the president of the United States is engaged in a cover-up," Pelosi told reporters. "A cover-up. And that was the nature of the meeting." Trump responded to Pelosi's comments by storming out of an infrastructure meeting with senior Democrats after only three minutes, before heading to the Rose Garden to host a surprise press conference. "I don't do cover-ups," Trump said before declaring that he would refuse to work with Democrats until they stop investigating him. "I want to do infrastructure," he continued. "I want to do it more than you want to do it. I’d be really good at that - that’s what I do. But you know what? You can’t do it under these circumstances. So get these phony investigations over with."

* **‘I pray for the president,’ Pelosi says after Trump cuts short infrastructure meeting, blasts Democrats.** "In an orchestrated – almost to an 'oh, poor baby' point of view – he came into the room and said that I said that he was engaged in a cover-up and he couldn't possibly engage in a conversation on infrastructure as long as we are investigating him," Pelosi said.

2/ **The House Intelligence Committee reached a last-minute deal with the Justice Department over the redacted material in the Mueller report and announced that it will not enforce the subpoena against Attorney General William Barr.** The DOJ agreed to turn over the material and the underlying information in Mueller's report, but committee chairman Adam Schiff said the subpoena "will remain in effect and will be enforced should the Department fail to comply with the full document request." Schiff said he expects the DOJ to finish turning over the 12 categories of counterintelligence and foreign intelligence material from Mueller's report "by the end of next week." In a letter sent to Schiff on Tuesday, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd warned that "the Department will not likely be able to continue to work with the Committee to accommodate its interest in these materials" if the committee takes "the precipitous and unnecessary action of recommending a contempt finding or other enforcement action against the attorney general."

3/ **The IRS must honor congressional requests for Trump's tax returns unless Trump invokes executive privilege to protect them**, according to a confidential draft legal memo written by IRS staffers. The memo undercuts Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin's argument that the White House doesn't have to comply with Congress' requests because they lack any "legitimate legislative purpose." Mnuchin said he came to that conclusion after consulting with attorneys from the Treasury Department, the IRS, and the Justice Department, but the memo says the Treasury Secretary does not have the authority to deny requests for taxpayer returns made by tax-writing committees in Congress.

* **New York lawmakers passed a pair of bills that would allow Congress to obtain Trump’s state tax returns.** Tax officials will now be authorized to hand over Trump's state returns to any one of three congressional committees.

4/ **Judge Edgardo Ramos ruled at a U.S. District Court hearing in New York that Congress has the legal authority to demand the Trump Organization's financial records from Deutsche Bank AG and Capital One Financial Corp.** Lawyers for Trump, his three older children, and the Trump Organization argued that the subpoenas should be quashed. The ruling clears the way for the banks to comply with subpoenas issued to them last month by two congressional committees, and comes just two days after a different federal judge in Washington, D.C. said Trump’s accounting firm has to comply with a congressional subpoena for Trump's personal financial records.

poll/ **70% of Americans say they have confidence in the condition of the U.S. economy and their own financial situation.** 41% of those who said the economy was in good shape also credited Trump's policies as the reason why the economy is doing well, up from 32% at the beginning of 2018. 41% of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president.

## Notables.

1. **Michael Cohen communicated more than 1,000 times over the course of eight months with the CEO of a U.S. money-management firm with ties to a Russian oligarch**, according to a warrant filed on Aug. 7, 2017. The exchanges between Cohen and Andrew Intrater of Columbus Nova LLC began the day Trump was elected, and Mueller's team was investigating whether payments to Cohen from Columbus Nova were connected to a plan to give Michael Flynn a proposal to lift sanctions against Russia. No charges were filed related to that particular inquiry. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-22/michael-cohen-filings-show-950-messages-with-oligarch-s-cousin))
