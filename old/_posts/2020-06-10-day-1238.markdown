* ### üò∑ Dept. of We Have It Totally Under Control.

* **Global**: Total confirmed cases: \~7,303,000; deaths: \~414,000; recoveries: \~3,425,000. ([Johns Hopkins University](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html))

* **U.S.**: Total confirmed cases: \~1,995,000; deaths: \~113,000; recoveries: \~525,000

* **At least 19 states are seeing a rise in the number of new coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in at least nine states have been on the rise since Memorial Day**. Data from states that are reporting some of their highest seven-day averages of new cases also disproves the notion that the country is seeing a spike because of an increase in testing. Meanwhile, 24 states are trending downward and seven states' trends are holding steady. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/10/health/us-coronavirus-wednesday/index.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/06/09/coronavirus-hospitalizations-rising/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html))

* **The White House coronavirus task force hasn't held a daily briefings in more than a month**, despite the virus killing up to 1,000 Americans per day. Trump and top White House officials, including Jared Kushner, insist that they "made every decision correctly," and that the outbreak is under control. "We may have some embers or some ashes or we may have some flames coming," Trump said last week, "but we‚Äôll put them out. We‚Äôll stomp them out." The task force has also scaled back its once-daily internal meetings, now meeting twice per week.

* **Data and public health experts contradict Trump's claim that the spike COVID-19 cases is because the U.S. is doing more testing**. Three states with some of the biggest surges in the disease caused by the coronavirus began reopening more than two weeks ago.

* **Asylum-seeking migrants detained at an Arizona ICE center with one of the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases say they were forced to clean the facility with inadequate personal protective equipment**. The migrants say the facility forced detainees to clean and work in the facility's kitchen during crowded meal times, clean the trash from the nurses' office, where sick patients were treated, and one said he was asked to clean the feces-covered cell of a mentally ill detainee without gloves. ICE's says that as of June 7, 78 detainees have tested positive at the La Palma facility, with 14 cases currently under monitoring and zero deaths.

* **Republicans have tentatively moved the Republican National Convention to Jacksonville, Fla.** The decision to seek an alternative location for the convention‚Äôs marquee events stems from Trump‚Äôs desire to accept his party‚Äôs nomination before an enormous crowd. North Carolina declined to allow a packed arena for the Aug. 24-27 event, as public health officials are urging Americans to avoid big gatherings, wear face coverings, and practice social distancing.

They're questions that need to be asked, and every case we can't jump on one side without looking at all the facts at play."

Gleeson rebuked the Justice Department's request to drop the case, saying the move for dismissal was ‚Äúcorrupt,‚Äù ‚Äúpolitically motivated," and that the department ‚Äúhas engaged in highly irregular conduct to benefit a political ally of the President." Gleeson added: ‚ÄúEverything about this is irregular.‚Äù ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/10/gleeson-flynn-sullivan-barr-justice-department-311018) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/michael-flynn-committed-perjury-but-should-not-face-contempt-hearing-court-appointed-counsel-finds/2020/06/10/09dada24-aa81-11ea-9063-e69bd6520940_story.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/us/politics/john-gleeson-michael-flynn.html) / [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/10/politics/michael-flynn-prosecutor-filing/) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/outside-lawyer-finds-michael-flynn-committed-perjury-discourages-judge-from-finding-him-in-contempt-11591806377?mod=djemalertNEWS))

Trump, however, shot down any discussions, tweeting, ‚Äúmy Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations.‚Äù ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/trump-confederate-generals-ecc596fe-5d37-4d8a-8a12-42656886446f.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/magazine/army-confederate-base-names.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage))

5/ **Trump's golf courses in Scotland are expected to receive a tax rebate of nearly ¬£1 million as part of a government bailout package for tourism businesses impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.** Trump's resorts in Aberdeenshire and Turnberry will both receive emergency funding from the Scottish government. Property taxes paid by hospitality, leisure and retail businesses in Scotland will be waived. Trump Turnberry owed ¬£850,766 in property taxes for this year, while Trump Aberdeenshire owed ¬£121,170. Both properties are expected to qualify for 100% relief. Both properties have also been able to avoid paying the main business tax in the UK, known as the corporation tax, because they consistently report such heavy losses due to their debts to Trump himself, which totaled ¬£155 million in 2018.
