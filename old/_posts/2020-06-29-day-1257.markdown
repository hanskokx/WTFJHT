1/ **Russian intelligence officers offered bounties to Taliban militants to kill U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan over the past year**, according to a classified U.S. intelligence assessment. Trump and administration officials were briefed on the Russian operation in recent months, while the U.S. was in the midst of [peace negotiations](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/06/08/day-1236/) with the Taliban to end the 18-year war in Afghanistan. The White House‚Äôs National Security Council also discussed the issue at an interagency meeting in late March. Additionally, U.S. intelligence officials and Special Operations forces in Afghanistan [alerted superiors](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/28/us/politics/russian-bounties-warnings-trump.html) about the covert Russian operation as early as January 2020. U.S. intelligence officials say the bounties are believed to have resulted in the deaths of multiple U.S. troops in the region over the last few years, though it is unclear exactly how many were targeted or killed under the program. The same Russian unit has been linked to assassination attempts and other covert actions in Europe and has offered rewards for successful attacks in the past.

2/ **Trump denied receiving an intelligence briefing on the alleged Russian bounty program**, tweeting that "nobody briefed or told me" and that he had "just" heard about it. Trump also claimed that the intelligence community didn't brief Pence or White House chief of staff Mark Meadows about the Taliban bounty payments because "they did not find this info credible." White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, meanwhile, claimed that Trump and other top administration officials were not "briefed on the alleged Russian bounty intelligence." Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe also ‚Äúconfirmed that neither the President nor the Vice President were ever briefed on any intelligence‚Äù related to a Russian bounty, and that all news reports ‚Äúabout an alleged briefing are inaccurate.‚Äù Trump added that "nobody has been tougher on Russia than the Trump Administration" and called for the New York Times, which broke the story, to "reveal" its sourcing. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/02975c59e71e65327e2f582cd1a91f43) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/trump-russia-bounties-taliban-3d95c9fc-b7b0-4789-840c-a4005a6914f5.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-says-he-wasnt-aware-of-russia-bounty-allegations-11593362109) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-says-no-credible-intel-russia-offered-taliban-bounty-payments-n1232376) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/28/884407572/trump-denies-briefing-on-russian-bounties-reportedly-placed-on-u-s-troops))

3/ **The White House insisted that Trump still ‚Äúhas not been briefed on the matter" of Russian bounties**. Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany suggested that the intelligence was unconfirmed, saying there was ‚Äúno consensus,‚Äù that there were ‚Äúdissenting opinions,‚Äù and that the ‚Äúveracity of the underlying allegations continue to be evaluated.‚Äù As she spoke, however, administration officials were briefing a limited number of House Republicans at the White House on intelligence that Russia offered bounties. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-lawmakers-reports-russia-put-bounties-us/story?id=71512232) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-29/trump-wasn-t-briefed-on-russia-due-to-no-consensus-mcenany-says) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/29/nancy-pelosi-demands-briefing-russian-bounties-344219) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/29/884611485/congress-unites-to-demand-answers-from-trump-on-russian-bounties-in-afghanistan) / [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/29/politics/congress-reaction-trump-administration-russia-bounty-intelligence))

* **White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany: "I think it‚Äôs time that The New York Times and The Washington Post hand back their Pulitzers.‚Äù** During the briefing, a reporter asked, ‚ÄúIf he hasn‚Äôt been briefed, how is he certain that Russia didn‚Äôt put out this bounty?‚Äù McEnany responded, accusing The New York Times of being ‚Äúabsolutely irresponsible‚Äù reporting that Trump had, in fact, been briefed. She then called on the Times and Post to turn in their Pulitzers before abruptly ending the briefing.

4/ **Trump promoted a video on Twitter of a supporter shouting "White power! White power!‚Äù from a golf cart bearing ‚ÄúTrump 2020‚Äù and ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù signs**. Trump retweeted the racist video ‚Äì which shows a white man driving past anti-Trump protesters at a Florida retirement community and shouting racist rhetoric ‚Äì¬†and thanked the "great people of The Villages" in the video. He deleted the tweet more than three hours later. White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere later claimed that Trump "did not hear the one statement made on the video," adding that all Trump saw "was tremendous enthusiasm from his many supporters."

5/ **Trump retweeted a video of a white man and woman aiming a semiautomatic rifle and a handgun at peaceful black protesters in St. Louis**. The couple stood in front of their mansion with guns and repeatedly shouted ‚ÄúGet out!

6/ **Twitch temporarily suspended Trump's channel and Reddit banned its biggest community devoted to Trump**. Twitch suspended Trump's campaign channel for ‚Äúhateful conduct‚Äù that was aired on stream, saying the videos ran afoul of its rules against content that ‚Äúpromotes, encourages or facilitates discrimination, denigration, objectification, harassment or violence‚Äù based on an individual‚Äôs identity. Separately, Reddit banned the subreddit ‚ÄúThe_Donald‚Äù for consistently breaking its rules, including promoting hate based on "identity or vulnerability," antagonized other communities, and for failing to meet Reddit's "most basic expectations." The_Donald had more than 790,000 users devoted to posting memes, viral videos, and supportive content about Trump. \[*Editor's note: Where you at Twitter and Facebook?*\] ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/29/reddit-bans-pro-trump-forum-in-crackdown-on-hate-speech-344698) / [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307145/twitch-donald-trump-ban-campaign-account) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/twitch-bans-trump-hate-violations-1423ecb1-21f0-479c-ae64-fbe91b53070c.html) / [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/trump-suspended-from-twitch-as-reddit-bans-the-the_donald-and-additional-subreddits/?guccounter=1) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/technology/reddit-hate-speech.html) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/29/amazons-video-site-twitch-bans-trump-for-hateful-conduct.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/29/tech/reddit-hate-policy/index.html))

7/ **The World Health Organization warned that the coronavirus pandemic is "speeding up" and the ‚Äúworst is yet to come.‚Äù** Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus' comments come as the global number of coronavirus cases passed 10 million, with more than 500,000 deaths.

With more than 100,000 confirmed cases, Los Angeles County health officials [warned](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-29/l-a-county-issues-dire-warning-amid-alarming-increases-in-coronavirus) that conditions were deteriorating as data showed an "alarming increases in cases, positivity rates and hospitalization.‚Äù Florida reported 5,266 new cases of the coronavirus Monday, bringing its rolling seven-day average to a record high for the 22nd day in a row. South Carolina set a record on its rolling seven-day average for the 21st day in a row. Arizona saw a record high in hospitalizations and its seven-day rolling average for new cases is 12% higher than it was a week ago. In Texas, coronavirus-related hospitalizations reached a record high for the 16th day in a row, while its rolling seven-day average for cases topped 19 days in a row.

8/ **The Supreme Court struck down a restrictive abortion law in Louisiana that would have left the state with only one abortion clinic**. Chief Justice John Roberts, who joined the court‚Äôs liberals in the 5-to-4 decision, said "The Louisiana law imposes a burden on access to abortion just as severe as that imposed by the Texas law, for the same reasons. Therefore Louisiana‚Äôs law cannot stand under our precedents.‚Äù Roberts‚Äôs vote was unexpected because he dissented in the 2016 Texas case, which was essentially identical to the Louisiana case. The Louisiana law required any doctor offering abortion services to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles, which would have left one doctor at a single clinic to provide services for nearly 10,000 women who seek abortions in the state each year. In the past two weeks, Roberts has voted with the court‚Äôs liberals on job [discrimination against gay and transgender workers](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/06/16/day-1244/#3-the-supreme-court-ruled-that-the-1), on a program [protecting Dreamers](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/06/18/day-1246/#1-the-supreme-court-ruled-that-trump), and now on abortion.
